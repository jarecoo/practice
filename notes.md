# Top 3 Important Things to Me
This is what I think is specifically, concretely important, what gets me up in the morning. Below this part is a broader, abstract section on personal paradigm (why what’s important to me is important), as well as principles I think are important for living.

1. Family
    * Prioritize close, personal relationships (family, close friends, etc)
        *  Foster a loving, supportive, compassionate relationship with my kids and my wife. I want to be part of their life forever. Make the time we have together count.
            * I think fostering this relationship means more than just love. Love is the necessary foundation, and gives you the appreciation to enjoy the journey, but only love is a disservice since it can lead to permissiveness, timidity and enabling. The other part of being a good father, is actually being something for your kids. They need to be guided, helped, and directed, mostly by example. The best dads are the ones that combine deep, unconditional love for their family with a steady, firm example of who to be and how to live. That’s where the rest of this comes in.
        * Enjoy the moment, appreciate the time you have with your kids https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/80dsy9/lpt_after_working_with_terminally_ill_cancer/?st=JE4OAY9Q&sh=bab60a62
        * Remember, one day you pick your kid up and you’ll put him down for the last time https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/7upwj7/comment/dtmjxlf?st=JD63KIUB&sh=e4e4d783
        * “Happy people are committed to making time for and enjoying friends and family. They have people they count on and trust.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
        * “Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else” - Uncle Iroh
        * Appreciate the time you have with your loved ones. “Nell teaches aspects of parenthood never understood before. If she cries or makes a mess or decides to be contrary (and these are relatively rare), it doesn’t bother. There is always Chris’s silence to compare it to.” - Robert Pirsig, ZatAoMM
        * Remember your kids aren’t you. They’re their own people.
        * There are three parts to raising kids, as I see it, and the important pivot in parent comes at adulthood when you stop doing the first 2 and are executing solely on the last part. The tricky part is that you more or less dictate 1 and 2, but they dictate 3 and you need to be in tune with their needs and wants for that.
            * 1. Teach them how to do stuff (e.g. eat, walk, talk, ride a bike, do math, etc)
            * 2. Teach them what to be (e.g. morality, behavior, hard work, manners, etc)
            * 3. Provide emotional support, unconditional love, compassion, empathy, listening ear, encouragement
    * Raise my children to be thoughtful, empathetic, enlightened people, capable of finding their own positive value in life, and contributing to the betterment of others
2. Fulfillment - Personal, Professional, and Creative
    * Emphasize experience and memories over possessions and material goods; reduce waste
        * Traveling - See as much of the world as possible
        * Hiking/Camping
        * Motorcycling
        * Other Invigorating leisure activities
        * Photography
    * Either be improving life or enjoying it
    * Take pride in and control of my life, make it what i want as far as i am able, don’t let other people/institutions dictate my way of life
        * Live according to my family’s wants and needs, as well as my own.
        * Discipline
    * Find fulfilling work; try to do things for work that add net benefit to mankind or provide meaningful fulfillment personally
    * Taking care of my life, fixing the house, doing yard and house projects, etc
    * Learn as much as possible
    * Be fiscally literate so that me and my immediate family are comfortable
        * extra can go to compassionately and generously optimizing the human condition within my sphere of influence
3. Fitness - Physical & Mental
    * With only one life and one body to experience life with, you gotta take care of it as best you can.
    * Physical exercise
        * Be physically fit, healthy, and improve longevity of the life i do have.
            * “No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” - Socrates
    * Mental Health (https://youtu.be/mpZ6YT8OemI):
        * Goals and purpose
            * See no. 2
        * Internal Locus of Control
            * Meditation - Mindfulness
            * Understand what I can’t control and what I can.
            * “In distancing ourselves from negative thinking, we recognize that we’re not our thoughts.”
        * Positive Emotions
            * Be optimistic, content, thoughtful, confident, happy, calm, and meditative, assertive, etc. Life is worse voluntarily anxious, paranoid, depressed, or angry.
            * “Happy people pay attention to the good in others and the things that are going right…interpret other people and events around them in a positive light, and see opportunities and possibilities. And they take time to remember and be grateful for the good things in their lives.“
            * “Positive emotions that connect you to things larger than yourself boost happiness: awe, gratitude, thanksgiving, wonder at the universe, seeing beauty outside yourself.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
        * Social connections
            * See no. 1

## Principles, Practices, Strategies
### Death Gives Life Meaning
- “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2
- “Im not ready” - “No one ever is. We don't get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning, to know our days are numbered, your time is short.” - Dr. Strange and the Ancient One, in Dr. Strange
- "...we all die, and our respect for death should always lead us to have an appreciation for life rather than a paranoid existence." - Sam Harris
- Objectively, empirically, we are given this life and that’s it. Maybe there’s an afterlife, but we can’t prove that. Therefore, objectively speaking, all we can do is make the life we’re sure we have count for ourselves.
- ”Knowing the truth, which is that nothing matters, can actually save you in those moments. Once you get through that terrifying threshold of accepting that, then every place is the center of the universe, and every moment is the most important moment, and everything is the meaning of life." Dan Harmon, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de2grEPn7rg
- “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.” - Gandalf, LOTR
- “You rarely have time for everything you want in this life, so you need to make choices. And hopefully your choices come from a deep sense of who you are” - Fred Rogers
- Memento Mori
- “We all sorely complain of the shortness of time, and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives are either spent in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to do. We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.” -Seneca
- “If you’re like most people, you’ll spend most of your time in life tacitly presuming you’ll live forever. It’s like watching a bad movie for the fourth time, or bickering with your spouse, these things only make sense in light of eternity. There better be a heaven if I’m going to waste my time like this.” Sam Harris, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI3a5m-lFVg 19:25
- “I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.” #1 regret of dying people, reported by EoL nurse in The Guardian
- The irony of death and the cold, uncaring universe is that by locating yourself inside it, you can find a sense of awe, wonder, and gratitude.
- “Positive emotions that connect you to things larger than yourself boost happiness: awe, gratitude, thanksgiving, wonder at the universe, seeing beauty outside yourself.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
- “‘Watch the stars in their courses and imagine yourself running alongside them. Think constantly on the changes of the elements into each other, for such thoughts wash away the dust of earthly life.’ Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.47…Given that we’re in our bodies every day, it’s tempting to think that’s the most important thing in the world. But we counteract that bias by looking at nature—at things much bigger than us. A line from Seneca, which has since become a proverb, expresses Marcus’s insight well: The world itself is a huge temple of the gods. Looking at the beautiful expanse of the sky is an antidote to the nagging pettiness of earthly concerns. And it is good and sobering to lose yourself in that as often as you can.” The Daily Stoic, p.131
- “Sometimes we might be fearful of death, assuming it’s radically different to life. But like a beautiful wave, eventually it has to return to the ocean. In truth, they were never separate at all. We all have a different relationship with this idea of life or death, and there are so many things that feed into that, …{but} finding a degree of comfort with the reality of our impermanence is actually a really important part of living life fully, and enjoying our life as it is. The temptation is to see it as black and white, as two different things, but this idea of the ocean is really helpful. We look out at the ocean, and there’s real pleasure in seeing a wave emerge out of the ocean, in watching it unfold, in watching it travel. Each and every single wave is different. It has its own root, its own direction. And there’s something about the way that that wave is expressed that makes it unique. And yet, ultimately, each and every wave goes back into the ocean. But the wave hasn’t been lost; the water is still the same, it’s just gone back into the ocean. It’s come from the ocean, it’s gone back into the ocean. Something beautiful has been expressed, and yet nothing has been lost. Remembering this idea can bring a greater sense of peace to the mind and to our life.” Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Life and Death” Monday, July 9, 2018
- Life is an expression of the universe. “You are an aperture through which the universe is looking at and exploring itself.” - Alan Watts; “We are a way for the cosmos to know itself” - Carl Sagan
- As long as you live with purpose and pursue it, your life is beautifully expressed and nothing is lost.
- “The meaning of life is to give something meaning”
- “I don't think an ancient Stoic would ever really consider the question of his or her life's meaning. You're part of nature; that's your meaning. Sure, you're also part of a family and of a society, too, but even if you were cast alone on an island, the meaningfulness of your life would just never be in question.” https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/8z3b20/comment/e2gfpzm?st=JJNSXYQO&sh=7470a6dc
- “In a short time you’ll be nobody and nowhere, even as the great emperors Hadrian and Augustus are now.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.5 (The Daily Stoic, p.162)

### Live Life with Purpose - Find Your Meaning (See above Top 3)
- “First tell yourself what kind of person you want to be, then do what you have to do” -Epictetus, Discourses, 3.23.1-2a The Daily Stoic, p.136. Loving yourself helps you gain a sense of who you are and who you want to be, which must come before you can find your meaning and purpose in life. I think if you try living a purpose without knowing yourself (i.e. your wants and drives), this will just cause stress.
- ikigai - a Japanese concept that means "a {current} reason for being." The Happiness Equation, p. 101
- I genuinely think you should have fun; enjoy life however you can, as long as it’s healthy
- “You rarely have time for everything you want in this life, so you need to make choices. And hopefully your choices come from a deep sense of who you are” - Fred Rogers
- “Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it’s to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential — as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth. You’ll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you’re doing. There are a million ways to sell yourself out, and I guarantee you’ll hear about them. To invent your own life’s meaning is not easy, but it’s still allowed, and I think you’ll be happier for the trouble.” - Bill Waterson
- “Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.” -Gandhi
- “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment” - Ralph Waldo Emerson
- “If you live for weekends and vacations, you’re shit is broken” -Gary Vaynerchuck
- Once you’ve found your reason for being, always live true to it and pursue it.
- Find what matters to you (”Knowing the truth, which is that nothing matters, can actually save you in those moments. Once you get through that terrifying threshold of accepting that, then every place is the center of the universe, and every moment is the most important moment, and everything is the meaning of life." Dan Harmon, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de2grEPn7rg)
- Find out what enjoying and being fulfilled by life means to you. This will give you your purpose in life, your ikigai.
- Either be improving life or enjoying it
- Find who you are and love yourself for it.
- Make sure it doesn’t hurt anyone
- “I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.” #1 regret of dying people, reported by EoL nurse in The Guardian
- This is intrinsic motivation, do it for you
- For me it was building a family, getting married, raising kids and spending time with my family. But also stuff like being outside in nature, seeing the world, and building something.
- “Of all the paths you take in life, make sure some of them are dirt.” John Muir
- “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2
- Find 3 hobbies: one to make you money, one to keep you in shape, and one to keep you creative.
- “Retirement, as we think of it today, isn’t a dream we actually want. We don’t actually want to do nothing. We just want to do something we love.” The Happiness Equation, p. 123. You need a hobby, a creative outlet, but more than that you need to be fulfilled.
- “Life without design is erratic. As soon as one is in place, principles become necessary.” - Seneca, Moral Letters, 95.46; The Daily Stoic, p.98
- Be something. Anything. It can change, but just pick. This is your anchor, your foundation, it’s what you come back to and how you help make sense of the world and what you push for for yourself and your interests. Run with it until you need to adapt or adjust it, and make sure your always open to adjusting it, not always adjusting it, but just open to adjusting it if you need to. “When we do not express ourselves, do not assert our being, do not stand up for our values in contexts where it is appropriate to do so, we inflict wounds on our sense of self. The world does not do it to us - we do it to ourselves.” The Six Pillars of Self-esteem, p 124
- “Like bluebonnets in the spring, We're only here for a little while. It's beautiful and bittersweet, So make the most of every mile. So pack light and love heavy, Give it all your heart and soul, so in the end You won't regret one thing” - “Bluebonnets in the Spring” Aaron Watson
- “’Show me that the good life doesn’t consist in its length, but in its use’” the Daily Stoic, p.157
- It’s possible to have a short life that is full, it’s possible to have a long life that is empty. The number of years you get doesn’t matter, just how you fill them up. “‘Show me that the good life doesn’t consist in its length, but in its use, and that it is possible — no, entirely too common — for a person who has had a long life to have lived too little’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 49.10b Show yourself. That no matter how many years you’re ultimately given, your life can be clearly and earnestly said to have been a long and full one.” The Daily Stoic, p.157
- The flood irrigation principle: when using a shovel to irrigate a field, you can’t just make dams everywhere you don’t want water to go. far more effective and useful is to give the water somewhere to go. The interesting subtlety is that the water will go somewhere whether you like it or not, it’s just up to you to decide where.

### Live Life on Purpose
- “‘First tell yourself what kind of person you want to be, then do what you have to do’ -Epictetus, Discourses, 3.23.1-2a … An archer is unlikely to hit a target she did not aim for” The Daily Stoic, p.136
- “You rarely have time for everything you want in this life, so you need to make choices. And hopefully your choices come from a deep sense of who you are” - Fred Rogers
- Try to never do anything on autopilot, especially in respect to your purpose in life, never execute on it on autopilot. The best way to live is to be present at every moment, and live in the now. Bringing awareness and mindfulness to the present will not only keep you grounded, it will keep you happy. You can bring awareness to your forward thinking self as well, being present in the now doesn’t preclude any sort of proactive, goal-oriented, or analytical living, it just brings a presence to it.
- Mindfulness is about present and purposeful living. It’s not wholly about sitting with eyes closed and body still, but about slowing the mind down to bring presence and purpose to every moment. You can be active and also be mindful. You can be ambitious and also be mindful. At a simple level it’s just about presence and purpose in life.
- I think mindfulness meditation, stoicism, and the other ideas I have in here aren’t only about just slowing down to a pace that might interfere with your relationships with others. It’s about having purpose to your pace. Most of the time that will mean slowing down the pace so you aren’t in a frenzy, but it will also allow you to purposefully act quickly when needed. Purposeful action is smooth. Purposeful action is deliberate, and therefore “slow”
- Actively choose something in every circumstance, because if you don’t, a choice will be made for you by default and it probably won’t be in your control, or something that you like.
- Focus on what matters. “Which will help your children more — your insight into happiness and meaning, or that you followed breaking political news every day for thirty years?” The Daily Stoic, p.116
- There may or may not be an afterlife, hopefully there is, but the point is we cannot know. This just means you should try to make your time count that you know you have. No afterlife should breed appreciation and gratitude for what you have, rather than lead to a paranoid and anxious existence
- “Im not ready” - “No one ever is. We don't get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning, to know our days are numbered, your time is short.” Dr. Strange and the Ancient One
- “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.” - Gandalf, LOTR
- “If you’re like most people, you’ll spend most of your time in life tacitly presuming you’ll live forever. It’s like watching a bad movie for the fourth time, or bickering with your spouse, these things only make sense in light of eternity. There better be a heaven if I’m going to waste my time like this.” Sam Harris, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI3a5m-lFVg 19:25
- Live each moment as if it’s the last thing you’ll ever do.
- “Don’t forget to ask: ‘is this really the life I want?’ Every time you get upset, a little life leaves the body. Are these really the things on which you want to spend that priceless resource?” The Daily Stoic, p.52
- “We all sorely complain of the shortness of time, and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives are either spent in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to do. We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.” -Seneca
- Anxious, abstract, conscientious people miss the moment by overthinking. Overly practical, never-analyzers miss the moment because they live by default. There is a middle ground.
- “Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing.” Oscar Wilde, Dorian Gray
- Technology addiction can distract you from living on purpose. Use it wisely and mindfully.
- “The person is free who lives as they wish, neither compelled, nor hindered, nor limited — whose choices aren’t hampered, whose desires succeed, and who don’t fall into what repels them” - Epictetus, Discourses, 4.1.1-3a (The Daily Stoic, p.74)
- If it’s not a hell yes, it’s a no.
- “Chaos ensues from not having a plan. Not because plans are perfect, but because people without plans - like a line of infantry without a strong leader - are much more likely to get overwhelmed and fall apart.” The Daily Stoic, p.98
- “As we examine our past behavior, it’s sad how often we find this to be the case - that we were not acting consciously or deliberately but instead by forces we did not bother to evaluate.” The Daily Stoic, p.100
- “One of the hardest things to do in life is to say ’No.’ To invitations, to requests, to obligations…Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement, distraction, obsession, lust. …Run amok, they become a commitment like anything else. Do you ever wonder how you can get some of your time back, how you can feel less busy? Start by learning the power of ‘No!’ - The Daily Stoic p.11
- “The more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do. This will let you live and enjoy your life — the life that you want.” - The Daily Stoic p.11
- “‘Every habit and capability is confirmed and grows in its corresponding actions, walking by walking, running by running…therefore, if you want to do something make a habit of it, if you don’t want to do that, don’t, but make a habit of something else instead.’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.1-5; Think about your activities of the last week as well as what you have planned for today and the week that follows. The person you’d like to be, or the person you see yourself as — how closely do your actions actually correspond to him or her? Which fire are you fueling? Which person are you becoming?” The Daily Stoic, p.147
- “Evaluate what you are doing, why you are doing it, and where accomplishing it will take you. If you don’t have a good answer, then stop” -Epictetus, Discourses, 4.4.41; 43 (TDS p.164)

### Cultivate an Internal Locus of Control
- “‘The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to with the choices I actually control.’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.5.4-5; The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can chance and what we can’t…time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not spent on the things we can change.” The Daily Stoic, p.9
- “If we’re always fighting, trying to stay in control, hold on to things, then there’s always a lot of tension in the mind, and the more tension there is, the more rigid things are, and therefore the more easily they’re upset” Headspace, Balance, Day 7
- “‘It isn’t events themselves that disturb people, but only their judgments about them’ - Epictetus, Enchiridon, 5; The samurai swordsman Musashi made a distinction between our ‘perceiving eye’ and our ‘observing eye.’ The observing eye sees what is. The perceiving eye sees what things supposedly mean. Which do you think causes the most anguish?” The Daily Stoic, p.112
- Outlook and attitude aren’t just important, they dictate how you experience the world, and they are the only thing you have 100% control over, so choose to be happy first, choose to see the good, choose gratitude instead of guilt, appreciation instead of anxiety, happiness instead of discontentment.
- Circumstances don’t dictate your happiness, your attitude does.
- “For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who had failed to do so, his mind will remain his greatest enemy.” - the Bhagavad Gita
- “If a person gave away your body to some passerby, you’d be furious. Yet you hand over your mind to anyone who comes along, so they may abuse you, leaving it disturbed and troubled - have you no shame in that?” Epictetus, Enchiridion, 28 “Maintain control over your mind and perceptions…, It’s your most prized possession”The Daily Stoic, p.78
- “‘You have been formed of three parts - body, breath, and mind. Of these, the first two are yours insofar as they are only in your care. The third alone is truly yours’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 12.3 Up until the very end, our mind is ours. It’s not that the other two parts of life don’t matter. THey’re just less ‘ours’ that our mind” The Daily Stoic p.125
- “There really is no such thing as an objectively good or bad occurrence…Situations require our participation, context, and categorization in order to be ‘bad’ [or good]” - The Daily Stoic, p.64
- Since you bring meaning to circumstances and occurrences, be deliberate about what meaning you ascribe to them (see: Live Life on Purpose)
- “The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company...a church....a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude...I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you...we are in charge of our attitudes.”
- If it’s possible to have extremely good circumstances, but still be the most wretched miserable person in the world, then it’s possible to be happy, hopeful, and positive in the worst possible circumstances. You dictate how you feel, not your circumstances or environment.
- “Here’s the secret to being happy. Just pretend you are happy and eventually you’ll forget you’re pretending”
- Working hard and achieving success doesn’t lead to happiness. Being happy first leads to success.
- “Be happy => Great Work => Big Success” The Happiness Equation, p.6
- “Petty frustrating crap is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don’t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to I’m going to be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop.” Deliberately choose your outlook - This is Water, David Foster Wallace https://vimeo.com/107746121 - Mindfulness
- “If you really learned how to think, how to pay attention, then you will know that you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow consumer-hell-type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness that all things, not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that’s capital T true is that you get to decide how you’re gonna try and see it.” David Foster Wallace, This is Water, https://vimeo.com/107746121
- Focus on the positive - try to remember the lottery that you’ve already one: you’re alive (most people who’ve lived on earth aren’t), you get to experience life, you have more money than most people in the world, you get to cuddle your kids and your wife, etc.
- See your life from a measured, but more broad perspective: https://vimeo.com/55073825
- “Positive emotions that connect you to things larger than yourself boost happiness: awe, gratitude, thanksgiving, wonder at the universe, seeing beauty outside yourself.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
- “Happy people pay attention to the good in others and the things that are going right…interpret other people and events around them in a positive light, and see opportunities and possibilities. And they take time to remember and be grateful for the good things in their lives.“
- “Happy people are committed to making time for and enjoying friends and family. They have people they count on and trust.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
- Negative emotions don’t usually lead to positive ones. Worrying about something won’t lead to peace of mind about it. Just be optimistic, content, thoughtful, confident, happy, calm, and meditative, assertive, etc. Life is worse when you choose negative emotions: anxiety, paranoia, sadness, or anger (“The wise person will endure that, but won’t choose it — choosing to be at peace, rather than at war” Seneca, Moral Letters, 28.7, The Daily Stoic, p.46)

- “Watch your thoughts. They become words. Watch your words. They become deeds. Watch your deeds. They become habits. Watch your habits. They become character. Character is everything. Character becomes your destiny.” - Lao tzu
- "Desire is not the problem. Clinging as a result of craving is. Thirst is not a desire or a craving. It is a sensation. Hunger is not a desire or a craving. It is a sensation. In any case, you are free to have desires and even pursue them. What will cause suffering is by clinging to the things you desire and crave, clinging to things that are not permanent as permanent, clinging to fantasies that do not accord with the way things are, clinging to the past even though it no longer exists, etc” (https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/559nfd/comment/d88qowc?st=ITQK2V7D&sh=0acbad15)
- "Ceaseless, ardent desire - if not bad in itself - is fraught with potential complications…when we pine for something, when we hope against hope, we set ourselves up for disappointment…That green light that Gatsby strove for can represent seemingly good things too, like love or a noble cause. But it can wreck someone all the same.” The Daily Stoic, p.61
- If a person wasn’t wanting something outside of their own control, why would they be stricken by anxiety?” Epictetus, Discourses, 2.13.1
- Happiness is now. You choose to be happy now - “When we chase after happiness as a movement, it’s away from the present moment to another place, to some time other than now. And because we move away from the present moment, ironically, we move further away from happiness. Because when you think about it, happiness can only exist in this moment, right here, right now.” Chasing Happiness, Headspace video, https://my.headspace.com/play/79
- “It is quite impossible to unite happiness with a yearning for what we don’t have.’ Epictetus, Discourses, 3.24.17 Locate that yearning for more, better, someday and see it for what it is: the enemy of your contentment. Choose it or your happiness.” The Daily Stoic, p.57
- “Why bother getting mad at causes and forces far bigger than us?…After all, external events are not sentient beings - they cannot respond to our shouts and cries.” The Daily Stoic, p.63
- "...we all die, and our respect for death should always lead us to have an appreciation for life rather than a paranoid existence." - Sam Harris
- Find the right perspective to view the world from - sometimes its big, sometimes its small, sometimes in between. “Nell teaches aspects of parenthood never understood before. If she cries or makes a mess or decides to be contrary (and these are relatively rare), it doesn’t bother. There is always Chris’s silence to compare it to.” - Robert Pirsig, ZatAoMM

- “Someone can’t frustrate you, work can’t overwhelm you,  these are external objects, and they have no access to your mind. Those emotions you feel, as real as they are, come from the inside, not the outside…We can’t blame other people for making us stressed or frustrated any more than we can blame them for our jealousy. The cause is within us.” The Daily Stoic, p.88
- “The more you familiarize the mind and body with appreciation, the more it arises in your life” - Headspace, “Appreciation” #7
- “The cause of irritation - or our notion that something is bad - that comes from us, from our labels or our expectations. Just as easily, we can change those labels; we can change our entitlement and decide to accept and love what’s happening around us.” The Daily Stoic, p. 89
- “People seek retreats for themselves in the country, by the sea, or in the mountains. You are very much in the habit of yearning for those same things. But this is entirely the trait of a base person, when you can, at any moment, find such a retreat in yourself. For nowhere can you find a more peaceful and less busy retreat than in your own soul - especially if on close inspection it is filled with ease.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.3.1; The Daily Stoic, p.91
- “We can find a retreat at any time by looking inward. We can sit with our eyes closed and feel our breath go in and out. We can turn on some music and tune out the world. We can turn off technology or shut off those rampant thoughts in our head. That will provide peace. Nothing else.” The Daily Stoic, p.91
- “There are two ways to be wealthy - to get everything you want, or to want everything you have. Which is easier right here and right now?” The Daily Stoic, p.95
- The law of attraction, or in motorcycle terms, target fixation, is what causes outlook to heavily influence outcome. When you fixate and focus on something, you subconsciously gravitate to that thing. Focus on the bad and you’ll live the bad. Focus on the good and you’ll live the good.
- “Your mind will take the shape of what you frequently hold in thought, for the human spirit is colored by such impressions” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.16; in The Daily Stoic, p.103
- Find a place of calm and strength inside yourself. Learn to love and have compassion for yourself like a very accepting, supportive parent would love you. Love yourself like Fred Rogers would love you. “When you’re capable of loving, accepting, and forgiving yourself no matter what, you’ll have the emotional energy to love, accept, and forgive others. When your cup is full of love to yourself, you could give more to others.” (https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/8api2x/fear_of_not_being_good_enough_episode_2_constant/?st=JFSBV4P2&sh=fc412057)

- “‘When you first rise in the morning tell yourself: I will encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.1 …The point of this preparation is not to write off everyone in advance. It is that, maybe, because you’ve prepared for it, you’ll be able to act with patience, forgiveness, and understanding” The Daily Stoic, p.108
- “From the very beginning, make it your practice to say to every impression ‘you are an impression and not at all what you appear to be.” Next, examine and test it by the rules you possess, the first and greatest of which is this - whether it belongs to the things in our control or not in our control, and if the latter, be prepared to respond, ‘It is nothing to me’” Epictetus, Enchiridon, 1.5; The Daily Stoic, p.111

### Live in the Present Moment
- “‘Let us therefore set out whole-heartedly, leaving aside our many distractions and exert ourselves in this single purpose, before we realize too late the swift and unstoppable flight of time and are left behind. As each day arises, welcome it as the very best day of all, and make it your own possession. We must seize what flees.’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 108.27b-28a What will you manage to make of today before it slips from your fingers and becomes the past? When someone asks you what you did yesterday, do you really want the answer to be ‘nothing?’” The Daily Stoic p.143

- “‘I don’t complain about the lack of time…what little I have will go far enough. Today — this day — will achieve what no tomorrow will fail to speak about.

- Pause to look around before it’s behind you -hiking adage
- “I have realized that the past and future are real illusions, that they exist in the present, which is what there is and all there is.” - Alan Watts
- “We are living in a culture entirely hypnotized by the illusion of time, in which the so-called present moment is felt as nothing but an infintesimal hairline between an all-powerfully causative past and an absorbingly important future. We have no present. Our consciousness is almost completely preoccupied with memory and expectation. We do not realize that there never was, is, nor will be any other experience than present experience. We are therefore out of touch with reality. We confuse the world as talked about, described, and measured with the world which actually is.” - Alan Watts

### Settle Down - Cultivate a Relaxed Attitude
- “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2
- “If a person wasn’t wanting something outside of their own control, why would they be stricken by anxiety?” Epictetus, Discourses, 2.13.1
- Anxiety is just you wanting to control that which is outside your control. Stress is modern-day smoking. Unconditionally relax.
- Things are fine. You’re ok. You’re not perfect. Learn to let things go. Holding on to negative emotions ruins your life.
- Give yourself an unconditional break. Forgive yourself. Trust yourself. Trust your loved ones. Have compassion for yourself.
- Don’t take everything so seriously. It’s good to be good, but nobody’s perfect. Cut everything and everyone some slack and don’t expect perfection anywhere, especially from yourself or your family or circumstances. https://reddit.app.link/1O3LUJUxrN You may think you’re just “optimizing” but you may find that you just come across as critical and judgmental.
- “Don’t hang on to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.”
- “Having low self worth, not being compassionate toward yourself can cause trouble elsewhere in your life. If we have an attitude of low self worth and are constantly telling ourselves we’re the worst in the world, “we are at the same time cultivating a mind that is quite critical and judgmental and which inevitably spills over. So as we let go of this negative chatter towards ourself, we are at the same time freeing ourselves up from any judgment, criticism about others.” - headspace, self-esteem 24/30
- Reflect on your many blessings, not your few failures.
- Realize that there will always be downsides, imperfections, mistakes, harm, etc. Ride the waves, find your own inner peace. (mediation) (“there is no effort without error and shortcoming“)
- “A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it” - Jean de La Fontaine

- “Make sure you’re not made ‘Emporer,’ … Keep yourself simple, good, pure, saintly, plain” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.30; The Daily Stoic, p.106. Over-happiness and excitement can be just as detrimental as as over-sadness or anger. You should seek to have the same aversion to over-happiness as you do to over-sadness, because they’re both mental agitation. Seek to be even-keeled, but don’t be afraid of emotion, it’s natural. Just be deliberate and mindful of the state when emotions are high.

- “Life is hard enough. Let's not take our mind too seriously.” - Life and Laughter, Mon. July 2, 2018, Headspace
- “No amount of guilt can change the past and no amount of anxiety will change the future.”
- “You don’t need to fix things that lie outside of your control. You also don’t need to fix the anxiety; it is a feeling that you have; it is therefore not you. The need to fix, to control is what fuels the anxiety in the forest place. Let it be, and it will lose its excessive force.” - Darren Brown, Happy

### Slow Down
- “Slow your breath down, just take it slow” - Future of Forestry, Slow your Breath Down
- Slowing down probably isn’t necessarily about moving at a snail’s pace at all times, it’s probably more about moving deliberately and purposefully. I think usually that will mean a slower, smooth, steady pace to your life, but won’t prevent you from acting quickly when necessary, being punctual, etc.
- Slow down. Hear people, listen to them fully before speaking. Don’t speak unless your sure it will bring value. “I begin to speak only when I’m certain what i’ll say isn’t better left unsaid.” Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 4
- Respond, don’t react. Don’t immediately react to anything. Internalize it, then think about how best to respond.
- “The tools and aims of our training are unaffected by the turbulence of the moment. Stop. Regain your composure. It’s waiting for you.” The Daily Stoic, p.68
- Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
- “It’s the thinking mind alone that  wants to become bigger, to become better, or something special in the world. The other part, our essence, our awareness, has no such desire or ambition… Awareness is voiceless. It simply witnesses. It observes. It has no goal. It has no desire  to change anything, to be something more, to be something better. It simply witnesses life as it unfolds. As much as we need the thinking mind, the mind that plans and strives, at the same time that mind is typically quite busy. it’s trying to change, it’s trying to reach for something bigger and better and of course there are times in our life when that’s entirely appropriate and even necessary. But so often, when we think about ourselves in this way, that’s just not particularly helpful. Rather than being happy with ourselves as we are or content with ourselves as we are, we’re so busy trying to be somebody different, that we can’t even experience that sense of contentment in this moment right now. So learning to rest in awareness, we rely less on that thinking mind, the thinking mind that’s always reaching for something else, and instead we start to appreciate the value of resting right here in this moment right now.” Headspace, “Everyday Headspace,” Tuesday, June 19, Awareness and Ambition
- Reset. Readjust. Restart. Refocus. As many times as you need to.
- Patience. Sometimes stuff just needs time, no action, just time.

### Simplify
- Enough is better than more.
- “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2
- “Approach each task as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity,  and complaint over your fair share” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.5

- You can create space, avoid business, and simplify “by Removing [simplifying] Choice [choose between fewer things], Removing Time. [willingly push deadlines up],  and Removing Access [limit the access to mind and time to 1 thing you control], and nurture that space, that powerful space, so it fills your mind and time and life with contentment, freedom, and happiness.” The Happiness Equation p. 204
- Love people, use things.
- “Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants” Epictetus, The Happiness Equation, p. 82
- Find the very few things that are the absolute most important and focus most of your energy on them. Minimalism isn’t about getting rid of things, it’s about elevating a few very important things to the forefront of your life. It’s about not having to panic clean for visitors. It’s about having more money for the things you truly enjoy because you’re not buying everything in sight. It’s about valuing the few things you have. It’s about valuing people and experiences over things. It’s about simplifying your life, reducing complexity and complication. https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/8qv2sm/minimalism_for_me_is/?st=JIDXYDM4&sh=45904b51
    - “Minimalism for me is not buying junk I don't need so that I have more disposable income for things I really enjoy.”
    - ‘Minimalism for me is: "If it's not a HELL YES, it's a NO.”’
    - “Minimalism for me, ideally, is being able to envision all of your possessions, their practical uses, maintenance, and replacement/replenishment in your mind's eye. Let nothing stay unseen and simply eat up space.” - bring mindfulness, intention and purpose to everything you have. elevate the possessions that are truly important and let the rest go.
    - “Minimalism for me is being able to lead a life free of unnecessary complications, having simple long lasting products that i can rely on daily, so i know that i can get the most out of the day without wasting it on unneeded complications”
    - “Minimalism for me is putting in place a one in one out rule for my kids’ toys so that they learn to value what they have rather than always wanting to buy more as well as making sure that what We have in our house has a use and a place so that we have less clutter.”

- The things my patients say they'll miss the most are NOT seeing the World Landmarks, buying fancy things, that new car, "living it up" party style, etc. (https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/80dsy9/lpt_after_working_with_terminally_ill_cancer/). Here is an actual compiled list:
    * Watching my sons throw a baseball
    * Listening to my grandparents tell stories
    * My girlfriend surprising me with a kiss on the cheek
    * Holding my wife in my arms knowing there's no where in the world I'd rather be
    * Gram's Sunday dinners and the whole family getting together
    * My dog
    * Seeing my fiancé smile and feeling his arms wrap around me
    * My daughter running to me when I get home
    * The smell of flowers and rain
    * The day I got married. I said I never would. And then I met her. And now I have to leave her.
    * Smelling the fireplace on Christmas morning with the family
    * All my friends
    * Watching my family sleep
    * The rush of weekday mornings. I know it sounds crazy, but I'll miss it. I'll miss the coffee, the crowded bathrooms, my wife's quick peck goodbye, the kids forgetting their lunch.. you get my point
    * Rain. Is that weird?
....notice none of these things cost any money. They don't include technology. They're not grand gestures. It's human to human (or animals/nature) interaction, something we need more of in world that's becoming more fast paced and less human every day. Revamp your bucket list. Live in the moment. Put down your phone. Notice the people around you.
- “‘Don’t set your mind on things you don’t possess as if they were yours, but count the blessings you actually possess and thing how much you would desire them if they weren’t already yours. But watch yourself, that you don’t value these things to the point of being troubled if you lose them.’ Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.27; Today, stop trying to get what other people have. Fight your urge to gather and hoard. That’s not the right way to live and act. Appreciate and take advantage of what you already have, and let that attitude guide your actions.” - The Daily Stoic, p.149
- “What if…you prioritized quality over quantity?…Your shelves might be emptier, but your brain and your life would be fuller” The Daily Stoic, p.154

### Balance
- “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2
- Rules are good, but be adaptable when they need to be broken.
- Figure out how to give yourself some mental space - Meditate
- “Block access. Protect your brain. Guard it. Remove all entry points to your brain except a single one you can control” - The Happiness Equation, p.194
- Learning to balance technology in your life (e.g. smart phone) is wicked important.
- “It’s really tempting to meditate for balance only when you’re feeling stressed or out of balance in some way. Often we just look to fix things when they already happen. But we should try and use the balance visualization {light above the head flowing into your body} on a regular basis, to really get comfortable with it to remind yourself of what it feels like to be grounded to have a sense of balance. The more time you spend in that place, the less likely you are to be overwhelmed. It’s no longer about putting out fires the whole time, instead it’s about preventing the fires from getting out of control in the first place. having the presence of mind to see thoughts and emotions beginning to run away and at the moment to say ‘I’m not going to do that this time. I’m just going to come back to that feeling of being present, of being balanced in both body and mind…Be aware throughout the day, find the moments in the day that you can remind yourself of this feeling of balance. In reminding yourself, all you’re doing is tapping back in to that innate quality of balance that’s always there. You’re reminding the mind what it’s like to rest in that space. The more you can do that, the more natural that tendency becomes, the more often you go to that place, the more time you spend in that place, and the greater the sense of balance there is in life” - Headspace, Balance, Day 3
- “An essential support for this inner sense of balance is understanding change…the experience of it, not the idea of it, not thinking about change, but really understanding from an experiential point of view, what it means that everything is changing from moment to moment. There’s always a certain amount of uncertainty in our life. If we can be comfortable resting in this uncertainty, then we find a very pleasurable sense of balance. If we’re always fighting, trying to stay in control, hold on to things, then there’s always a lot of tension in the mind, and the more tension there is, the more rigid things are, and therefore the more easily they’re upset, the more easily we fall out of balance. Learning to be comfortable with the fact that everything is changing, everybody is always changing, even our own thoughts and emotions, seeing that directly can really help lead to a greater sense of balance in the mind.” Headspace, Balance, Day 7

### The Importance of Love
- Love and Empathy for Self
    - Loving yourself is the starting place to everything else. It helps you develop a sense of who you are, and who you want to be. This is where you start from when you find and develop your purpose, once you have that you can begin to live on purpose, enjoy the moment, develop your character, etc. it all starts with loving your true self.
    - Healthy love starts with self-love, or self-compassion, and then goes out to another person in the form of intimacy and attachment. It ends with altruism.
    - “You rarely have time for everything you want in this life, so you need to make choices. And hopefully your choices come from a deep sense of who you are” - Fred Rogers
    - “You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection.” - Buddha
    - “Settling into your true, weird, authentic self isn’t easy, but it’s the most satisfying way to have everything” The Happiness Equation, p 243
    - Self awareness leads to self-discovery. Self-discovery leads to self-familiarity, which leads to self-satisfaction, self-love, and self-care.
    - Find a place of calm and strength inside yourself. Learn to love and have compassion for yourself like a very accepting, supportive parent would love you. Love yourself like Fred Rogers would love you. “When you’re capable of loving, accepting, and forgiving yourself no matter what, you’ll have the emotional energy to love, accept, and forgive others. When your cup is full of love to yourself, you could give more to others.” (https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/8api2x/fear_of_not_being_good_enough_episode_2_constant/?st=JFSBV4P2&sh=fc412057)
    - “As we build up the exercise, so we’ll shift our attention away from ourselves, and more towards others. But the starting place is with ourselves. If we don’t have a sense of calm, a sense of kindness, or forgiveness toward ourself, then it’s going to be really difficult to have that towards others. So the two things aren’t really so different, it’s like they’re two sides of the same coin. If we develop one, at the same time we’re developing the other.” - Headspace, Relationships, Session 3
    - “Self-care is not selfish. You cannot serve from an empty vessel.” - Eleanor Brownn
    - “Be you and be cool with it…There is nothing more satisfying than being loved for who you are and nothing more painful than being loved for who you’re not, but pretending to be.” The Happiness Equation, p.238
    - “Confidence isn’t ‘They will like me.’ Confidence is ‘I’ll be fine if they don’t.’”
    - “I can’t afford to hate people. I don’t have that kind of time.“ -Bob Ross (Applicable first to yourself)
    - “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” - MLK
    - “Hate is too great a burden to bear” -MLK
- Romanic Love and Empathy for Others
    - “I can’t afford to hate people. I don’t have that kind of time.“ -Bob Ross
    - “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” - MLK
    - “Hate is too great a burden to bear” -MLK
    - I genuinely think people need each other, not all in the same way, but we need people in our life who unconditionally love us and whom we love, however that’s actually expressed. It could be a spouse, a friend, a sibling, or maybe even a pet. I think humans need love and attachment in their life. Loving and being loved is an essential need. I chose a wife and kids, but that’s not a required path.
    - Find your village, your tribe, people you can depend on and who depend on you - “Happy people are committed to making time for and enjoying friends and family. They have people they count on and trust.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
    - “Revamp your bucket list. Live in the moment. Put down your phone. Notice the people around you.”
    - “Consciously consider whom you allow into your life - not like some snobby elitist, but like someone who is trying to cultivate the best life possible” The Daily Stoic, p.79
    - “You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with” Jim Rohn; The Happiness Equation, p.252
    - “Tell me whom you consort with and I will tell you who you are” Goethe, in The Daily Stoic, p.79
    - Nothing is more important than family, pick family first. (Family being defined as those individuals on whom you can best count for support and affection, ideally this should be blood relatives, but it can also be close friends)
    - “When you and your partner fight, remember it’s you and her vs the problem, not vs each other.”
    - “Where you invest your love, you invest your life” -Mumford and Sons, Awake my Soul
    - “Today study after study shows the it is our social connections that are the single biggest driver or our happiness.” -The Happiness Equation, p.114
    - On healthy relationships, romantic loves should naturally shift more toward attachment. Make sure you and your partner are worthy of each other’s full, trusting attachment.
    - “To love another person is to see the face of God” - Les Miserables
    - “The lesson I have learned is when someone you love is doing something that hurts you. Don't try and control them by making them stop. Rather have the courage to break up with them when they continue to do the thing you told them hurts you. If they wont stop, they don't love you and you should move on.”
    - “It’s impossible to love someone and control them at the same time” - Terry Crews.
    - Love is pure, unbiased appreciation of and compassion for another, and therefore comes without expectation of how the other should behave or be. To love someone is to let them be, without putting on them your expectation for what they might be or reciprocate. Therefore, you cannot control someone and love them at the same time. If they love you, they will reciprocate your love and appreciation for who you are, without putting on you the expectation of behavior, being, or reciprocation. This is why love and trust, especially in a committed romantic relationship, are so intertwined, and why love without trust is a rotten thing. This is unconditional love.
    - It’s not your job to keep the people you love happy. You individually be happy and bring that to the relationship.
    - “You cannot make a person happy. You can make a person smile, you can make a person feel good, you can make a person laugh, but whether or not a person is happy is deeply and totally and utterly out of your control…I said to Jada ’That’s it. I retire from trying to make you happy. I need you to go make yourself happy….’ And after we cracked the hell up we realized we had come into this false romantic concept that somehow when we got married that we would become one. And what we realized is that we were two completely separate people on two completely separate individual journeys and that we were choosing to walk our separate journeys together, but her happiness was her responsibility and my happiness was my responsibility. And we decided that we were gonna find our individual, internal private separate joy, and then we were gonna present ourselves to the relationship and two each other already happy, not coming to each other begging, with our empty cups out _demanding_ that she fill my cup and she meet my needs. It’s unfair and its kind of unrealistic and can be destructive to place the responsibility for your happiness on anybody other than yourself.” - Will Smith, Instagram Video,
    - “If you love someone, set them free. If they come back they're yours; if they don't they never were.” -Richard Bach
    - “It’s really important to find a partner who is at your level of happiness. Or higher. The good news is that you can be happy first.” The Happiness Equation, secret chapter ~p.266
    - ”For me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete (and correct) his own personality in that of another (and finally in children and even grandchildren) and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides. And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover; no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. In the end, they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself…After all, almost the main work of life is to come out of our selves, out of the little dark prison we are all born in. Masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process. The danger is that of coming to love the prison." -C.S. Lewis
    - “Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else” - Uncle Iroh
    - “Whenever someone has done wrong by you, immediately consider what notion of good or evil they had in doing it. For when you see that, you’ll feel compassion, instead of astonishment or rage.” Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.26; The Daily Stoic, p. 82
    - “Nobody thinks they’re wrong, even when they are. They thing they’re right, they’re just mistaken…Could it be that the slights you’ve experienced or the harm that others have done to you was not inflicted intentionally? What if they they simply thought they were doing the right thing - for them, even for you?…How much more tolerant and understanding would you be today if you could see the actions of other people as attempts to do the right thing?” The Daily Stoic, p.82
    - “‘When you first rise in the morning tell yourself: I will encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.1 …The point of this preparation is not to write off everyone in advance. It is that, maybe, because you’ve prepared for it, you’ll be able to act with patience, forgiveness, and understanding” The Daily Stoic, p.108

### Be Nice, but Be Assertive; or, Avoid Manipulation
- “When I do good I feel good. When I do bad I feel bad. That is my religion”
- Everyone deserves your unconditional kindness and generosity. As long as they respect and reciprocate that, it will flow freely. Once they abuse that, they have to earn it back. (They had their chance they blew it)
- Be nice but don’t let people take advantage of or manipulate you (see: live life on purpose). This will help you avoid manipulation and being taken advantage of, but will still provide you the chance to be compassionate to people without sacrificing compassion for yourself.
- You teach people how to treat you by what you tolerate. Being assertive keeps people from taking advantage of your niceness. If you only ever be nice, you’ll be an enabler, especially to your loved ones. Being assertive, asking for what you want, checking your close people, will lead to a place where you both get more of what you want and neither of you is allowed to let the worst parts of yourself grow (doubt, insecurity, anxiety, jealousy). It’s the Facebook effect. FB only ever served up the stuff you clicked on, which is usually the shit that gets you the most riled up in anger or disgust. Being too nice panders to every personality trait a person has, that's ok when you don't see the person a lot, but for close relationships that can bring out the bad parts of people as well as the good. You create codependency.
- “Be you and be cool with it…There is nothing more satisfying than being loved for who you are and nothing more painful than being loved for who you’re not, but pretending to be.” The Happiness Equation, p.238
- “When we do not express ourselves, do not assert our being, do not stand up for our values in contexts where it is appropriate to do so, we inflict wounds on our sense of self. The world does not do it to us - we do it to ourselves.” The Six Pillars of Self-esteem, p 124
- Be assertive about your wants, needs, and boundaries. On expressing yourself with your loved ones: I want your consent, I’d like your participation, I need neither. It’s not their job to make you happy and express your wants and needs for you. You have to do it.
- If you don’t speak your truth it’s like you’re suffocating yourself.
- The first thing to do when trying to walk the line between being nice and being assertive is to know who you are. When you have a firm grasp on who you are and what you want, you can then assert that.
- “You can lie down for people to walk on you and they will complain that you are still not flat enough. Live your life.”
- Doubt is the opposite of confidence. They cannot exist together. One has to yield to the other.
- “I do not accept your anger and your criticism. It is all yours. … If you become angry with me and I do not get insulted, than the anger falls back on you. You are the only one who becomes unhappy, not me. All you have done is hurt yourself.” -Buddha
- “It’s impossible to love someone and control them at the same time”
- “The lesson I have learned is when someone you love is doing something that hurts you. Don't try and control them by making them stop. Rather have the courage to break up with them when they continue to do the thing you told them hurts you. If they wont stop, they don't love you and you should move on.”
- “Of course I deprecate war, but if it is brought to my door the bringer will find me at home” - James Garfield, in The Daily Stoic, p.90
- “Trust, but verify”
- “‘When your sparring partner scratches or head-butts you, you don’t then take a show of it, or protest, or view him with suspicion or as plotting against you. And yet you keep an eye on him, not as an enemy or with suspicion, but with a healthy avoidance. You should act this way with all things in life. We should give a pass to many things with our fellow trainees.’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.20; The Daily Stoic 128
- “Whenever someone has done wrong by you, immediately consider what notion of good or evil they had in doing it. For when you see that, you’ll feel compassion, instead of astonishment or rage.” Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.26; The Daily Stoic, p. 82
- “Nobody thinks they’re wrong, even when they are.

- “Hate is too great a burden to bear” -MLK
- “‘Kindness is invincible, but only when it’s sincere, with no hypocrisy or faking. For what can even the most malicious person do if you keep showing kindness and, if given the chance, you gently point out where they went wrong — right as they are trying to harm you?’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5.9a …The expected reaction to hatred is more hatred…Most rudeness, meanness, and cruelty are a mask for deep-seated weakness. Kindness in these situations is only possible for people of great strength. You have great strength. Use it.” The Daily Stoic p.146

### Be Healthy - Physically and Mentally
- “‘Work nourishes noble minds’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 31.5 …The mind and the body are there to be used — they turn on themselves when not put to some productive end. It’s sad to think that this kind of frustration is an everyday reality for a lot of people…Worse is when we try to push these feelings away by buying things, going out, fighting, creating drama — indulging in the empty calories of existence instead of finding the real nourishment. The solution is simple and, thankfully, always right at hand. Get out there and work.” TDS, p.163
- Physical
    - “No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” - Socrates
    - Get good (consistent and long) sleep. Good sleep is underrated. It’s so vital to good health.
    - Exercise. Bodies are made for moving, not sitting.
    - “Exercise is a celebration of what you can do, not a punishment for what you ate”
    - Use food for sustenance, not pleasure. Modern bounty makes food-related sickness extremely common (high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, etc)
    - Avoid drinking soda. It’s poison. Consume sugar sparingly. Stick to whole foods, white meat and fish, lots of veggies, lots of fruits. Fewer carbs.
    - Go on at least 3 walks a week
- Mental
    - “Your brain is the most incredible and complex object in the universe. …The good news is for no money down…you get the one free copy of the universe’s most complex and powerful object. It’s yours for life…You break it, it’s broken. Seat belts, bike helmets and exercise are mandatory. For power, your brain recharges with six to eight hours of sleep a day and as much healthy food as possible.” The Happiness Equation p.193

    - Find a place of calm and strength inside yourself. Learn to love and have compassion for yourself like a very accepting, supportive parent would love you. Love yourself like Fred Rogers would love you. “When you’re capable of loving, accepting, and forgiving yourself no matter what, you’ll have the emotional energy to love, accept, and forgive others.

    - You should seek to have the same aversion to over-happiness as you do to over-sadness, because they’re both mental agitation. Seek to be even-keeled, but don’t be afraid of emotion, it’s natural. Just be deliberate and mindful of the state when emotions are high. (“If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same” If, Rudyard Kipling)
    - Build and support and rely upon and internal locus of control, motivation, and love.
    - Know what you can control and what you can’t; hint: you can only control your attitude and your mind. Let go of what you can’t control (God used to be my representation of what i couldn’t control, i would pass that all off to him, re-learn to let the things you can’t control go in some way)
    - At the end of the day, go over the positive things about it in your head. Positively introspect a little bit about your life, your relationships etc. Find the good about the day.
    - Find 3-5 things to be grateful for from the past week.
    - “The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5b
    - Your brain needs just as much exercise as your body. “Never retire. Your brain needs exercise or it will atrophy.” Bill Safire, quoting James Watson in a Jan 24 2005 op-ed
    - “When you’re through changing, you’re through” -Bill Safire, Jan 24 2005 op-ed
    - You gotta keep your brain active, as well as your body. Stay involved, stay active, keep learning, keep contributing.
    - “Carrying out five random acts of kindness a week dramatically improves your happiness” The Happiness Equation, p.21
    - “Anger as soon as it is fed, is dead - ’Tis starving makes it fat” -Emily Dickenson
    - “There is no more stupefying thing than anger, nothing more bent on its own strength. If successful, none more arrogant, if foiled, none more insane — since it’s not driven back by weariness even in defeat, when fortune removes its adversary it turns its teeth on itself.” - Seneca, On Anger, 3.1.5, The Daily Stoic, p.50

### Get Going: Analyze, Anticipate, but Act.
- “An archer is unlikely to hit a target she did  not aim for…our perceptions and principles guide us in the selection of what we want—but ultimately our actions determine whether we get there or not. So yes, spend some time—real, uninterrupted time—thinking about what’s important to you, what your priorities are. Then, work toward that and forsake all others. It’s not enough to wish and hope. One must act—and act right” The Daily Stoic, p.136
- it’s ok to think and analyze and plan, but the best course is always action.
- “It’s easier to act yourself into a new way of thinking than it is to think yourself into a new way of acting…Just do it.” The Happiness Equation, p.231
- “Immediately do the thing that scares you”.
- “But who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”
- but remember: “there is no effort without error and shortcoming“ -Teddy Roosevelt
- Choose to be in the fray for the right reasons, be mindful about it.
- You will regret the things you didn’t do a lot more than the things you did.
- “The turtle only makes progress when he sticks his neck out” -Myron Leavitt
- First try to limit the decisions you make. Don’t decide between everything, reduce choices to a very limited set of options. Then make a decision and go with it, don’t look back. Don’t give yourself the option to go back on a choice. Avoid the anxiety of choice.
- “The reversible condition {decision} is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness” (i.e. it’s better to consider all decisions irreversible; decide, act, and don’t look back) The Happiness Equation, p. 173
- “Autonomy and Freedom of choice are critical to our well being, and choice is critical to freedom and autonomy. Nonetheless, though modern Americans have more choice than any group of people ever has before, and thus, presumably, more freedom and autonomy, we don't seem to be benefiting from it psychologically.”
- Indecision is the death of opportunity
- The Do Circle, don’t wait for desire to do, or ability to do, simply doing can be a starting point to gain those two…It’s easier done than said… [Get] work done by doing it first.” The Happiness Equation, p. 219-224
- Get “‘closer to doing’…Spend 30 seconds putting yourself in a situation where it’s easier to do…Action causes motivation.” The Happiness Equation p.225-227
- Do something every day that will get your doing ball rolling, even if it’s a day that doesn’t require it. (e.g. Make your bed, clean your room, shower, get dressed.)

- “‘Those who receive the bare theories immediately want to spew them, as an upset stomach does its food. First digest your theories and you won’t throw them up. Otherwise they will be raw, spoiled, and not nourishing. After you’ve digested them, show us the changes in your reasoned choices, just like the shoulders  of a gymnasts display their diet and training, and as the craft of artisans show it what they’ve learned’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 3.21.1-3 …Today, or anytime, when you catch yourself wanting to condescendingly drop some knowledge that you have, grab it and ask: Would i be better saying words or letting my actions and choices illustrate that knowledge for me.” The Daily Stoic p.137

- Before acting: “First, don’t get upset — because that will color your decision negatively and make it harder than it needs to be. Second, remember the purpose and principles you value most.

### Learn to be Disciplined
- Find a routine; structure and discipline breed mental stability and general health
- “It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier, but you gotta do it every day. That’s the hard part, but it does get easier.” - Bojack Horseman
- https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/8ai05o/discussion_your_selfcontrol_is_your_most/?st=JFPOIU6B&sh=3ef2d937
- “A real man doesn’t give way to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage, and endurance - unlike the angry and complaining. The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5b
- “Once you learn that indulging might actually be worse than resisting, the urge begins to lose its appeal. In this way, self-control becomes the real pleasure, and the temptation becomes the regret” - The Daily Stoic, p.53
- Daily: meditate, plan, do, relax, meditate.
- Develop character
- “Character is a powerful defense in a world that would love to be able to seduce you, buy you, tempt you, and change you. If you know what you believe and why you believe it, you’ll avoid poisonous relationships, toxic jobs, fair-weather friends, and any number of ills that afflict people who haven’t thought through their deepest concerns. That’s your education. That’s why you do this work” The Daily Stoic, p.132
- Commit to things with substance, over which you have a measure of control. “‘Then what makes a beautiful human being? Isn’t it the presence of human excellence? Young friend, if you wish to be beautiful, then work diligently at human excellence. And what is that? Observe those whom you praise without prejudice. The just or the unjust? The just. The even-tempered or the undisciplined? The even-tempered. The self-controlled or the uncontrolled? the self-controlled. In making yourself that kind of person, you will become beautiful — but to the extent that you ignore those qualities, you’ll be ugly, event if you use every trick in the book to appear beautiful.’ Epictetus, Discourses, 3.1.6b-9; Our standards for what’s attractive are incredibly un-stoic in that we prize and extol things people have almost no control over — high cheekbones, complexion, height, piercing eyes. Is it really that beautiful to win the genetic lottery? Or should beauty be contingent on the choices, actions, and attributes we develop. An even keel, a sense of justice, a commitment to duty. These are beautiful traits — and they go much deeper than appearances.“ The Daily Stoic, p.140
- “Is something good or bad? Is this right or wrong? Ignore everything else. Focus only on your choices” The Daily Stoic, p.142
- “There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self.” - Ernest Hemingway
- “‘The greatest portion of peace of mind is doing nothing wrong. Those who lack self-control live disoriented and disturbed lives’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 105.7” The Daily Stoic p.145
- “The expected reaction to hatred is more hatred…Most rudeness, meanness, and cruelty are a mask for deep-seated weakness. Kindness in these situations is only possible for people of great strength. You have great strength. Use it.” The Daily Stoic p.146
- “Watch your thoughts. They become words. Watch your words. They become deeds. Watch your deeds. They become habits. Watch your habits. They become character. Character is everything. Character becomes your destiny.” - Lao tzu
- “‘Every habit and capability is confirmed and grows in its corresponding actions, walking by walking, running by running…therefore, if you want to do something make a habit of it, if you don’t want to do that, don’t, but make a habit of something else instead.’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.1-5; Think about your activities of the last week as well as what you have planned for today and the week that follows. The person you’d like to be, or the person you see yourself as — how closely do your actions actually correspond to him or her? Which fire are you fueling? Which person are you becoming?” The Daily Stoic, p.147
- “We are what we repeatedly do, therefore, excellence is not an act, but a habit.” -Aristotle (The Daily Stoic, p.147)
- “Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind” -Marcus Aurelius (The Daily Stoic, p.147)
- “The question is do you possess the constitution, the depth of faith, to go as far as is needed?” - Boondocks Saints
- “‘If you don’t wish to be a hot-head, don’t feed your habit. Try as a first step to remain calm and count the days you haven’t been angry. For habit is first weakened and then obliterated. When you can say I didn’t lose my temper today, or the next day, or for three or four months, but keep my cool under provocation, you will know you are in better health.’- Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.11b-14 Success {is} a matter of momentum. once you get a little, it’s easier to keep going…Start with one day doing whatever if is…Then do the same the following day and the day after that. Build a chain and then work not to break it. Don’t ruin your streak.” [But if you do, just start again with one day] The Daily Stoic, p.150
- “Habit is first weakened and then obliterated” - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.11b-14
- “Instead of seeing philosophy as an end to which one aspires, see it as something one applies. Not occasionally, bot over the course of a life — making incremental progress along the way. Sustained execution, not shapeless epiphanies. Epictetus love to shake his students out of their smug satisfaction with their own progress, …to reming them of the constant work and serious training needed every day if we are ever to approach that perfect form. It’s important for us to remember in our own journey to self-improvement: one never arrives. The sage — the perfect Stoic who behaves perfectly in every situation — is an ideal, not an end” The Daily Stoic p.151
- “That’s why philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training. For as time passes we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite” - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.9.13-14 (The Daily Stoic p.153)
- “‘The fortunate person is the one who gives themselves a good fortune’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.36’ What is the more productive notion of good luck? On that is defined by totally random factors outside your control, or a matter of probability that can be increased — though not guaranteed — by the right decisions and the right preparation?. Obviously the latter…Today, you can hope that good fortune and good luck magically come your way. Or you can prepare yourself to get lucky by focusing on doing the right thing at the right time.” The Daily Stoic p.158
- “Diligence is the mother of good luck” The Daily Stoic p.158
- “I am a great believer in luck. The harder I work, the more of it I seem to have.” -Coleman Cox (The Daily Stoic p.158)
- “Luck favors the prepared” - Edna Mode, The Incredibles
- “‘Joy for human beings lies in proper human work. And proper human work consists in: acts of kindness to other human beings, disdain for the stirrings of the senses, identifying trustworthy impressions, and contemplating the natural order and all that happens in keeping with it’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.26 (The Daily Stoic p.159)
- Learn the principle of iteration; It will make you or break you. (death by a thousand cuts; winning is a game of percentages: he who tries more, wins more; take more shots; “By small and simple things, great things are brought to pass.”)
- “‘Well-being is realized by small steps, but is truly no small thing’ -Zeno; the truth is one we know well: the little things add up….While the individual action is small, its cumulative impact is not…Choose the right way, and watch as all these little things add up toward transformation.“ The Daily Stoic p.161
- “‘Work nourishes noble minds’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 31.5 …The mind and the body are there to be used — they turn on themselves when not put to some productive end” TDS, p.163

### Be Smart
- You have a powerful brain, use it, exercise it. You want to keep it good and string for your whole life.
- “It is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it”
- Learn as much as you can, either about one field, or many.
- “Never retire. Your brain needs exercise or it will atrophy.” Bill Safire, quoting James Watson in a Jan 24 2005 op-ed
- “When you’re through changing, you’re through” -Bill Safire, Jan 24 2005 op-ed
- Get your ego out of it. “It is impossible for a person to begin to learn what he thinks he already knows” The Daily Stoic, p.84
- “Take a little time today to remember that you’re blessed with the capacity to use logic and reason to navigate situations and circumstances. This gives you unthinkable power to alter your circumstances and the circumstances of others. And remember that with power comes responsibility.” The Daily Stoic, p.86
- “What influences the ruling reason that guides your life? This means an exploration of subjects like evolutionary biology, psychology, neurology, and even the subconscious. Because these deeper forces shape even the most disciplined, rational minds…So don’t stop at Stoicism, but explore the forces that drive and make stoicism possible…Understand not only your ruling reason…but whoever and whatever rules that too.” The Daily Stoic, p.96
- “We must fight our biases and preconceptions…Ask yourself: What haven’t I considered? Why is this thing the way it is? Am I part of the problem here or the solution? Could I be wrong here?…We’re not as smart and wise as we’d like to think we are. If we ever do want to become wise, it comes from the questioning and from humility - not, as many would like to think, from certainty, mistrust, and arrogance.” The Daily Stoic, p.109
- “From the very beginning, make it your practice to say to every impression ‘you are an impression and not at all what you appear to be.” Next, examine and test it by the rules you possess, the first and greatest of which is this - whether it belongs to the things in our control or not in our control, and if the latter, be prepared to respond, ‘It is nothing to me’” Epictetus, Enchiridon, 1.5; The Daily Stoic, p.111
- “Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him” - Emerson, The Daily Stoic, p.113
- “If you want to learn, if you want to improve your life, seeking out teachers, philosophers, and great books is a good starts. But this approach will only be effective if you’re humble and ready to let go of opinions you already have.” The Daily Stoic, p.113
- “If you really learned how to think, how to pay attention, then you will know that you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow consumer-hell-type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness that connects all things, not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that’s capital T true is that you get to decide how you’re gonna try and see it. This, I submit, is the freedom of real education, of learning how to be well adjusted, you get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn’t. That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness.” David Foster Wallace, This is Water, https://vimeo.com/107746121
- “If anyone can prove and show to me that I think and act in error, I will gladly change it - for I seek the truth, by which no one has ever been harmed. The one who is harmed is the one who abides in deceit and ignorance.” Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.21; The Daily Stoic, p.127
- “No one should be ashamed at changing his mind - that’s what the mind is for….That’s why we go to such lengths to learn and expose ourselves to wisdom. It would be embarrassing if we didn’t end up finding out if we were wrong in the past” The Daily Stoic, p.127
- We should investigate things, challenge them, deconstruct them, and probe them; try to understand them by looking at them from a different angle. “’Turn it inside out and see what it is like - what it becomes like when old, sick, or prostituting itself’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.21 By examining situations from the inside out, we can be less daunted by them, less likely to be swayed by them.” The Daily Stoic, p.129
- “Just as what is considered rational or irrational differs for each person, in the same way what is good or evil and useful or useless differs for each person. This is why we need education, so that we might learn how to adjust our preconceived notions of the rational and irrational in harmony with nature.” Epictetus, Discourses, 1.2.5-7; The Daily Stoic, p.132
- “That’s why philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training. For as time passes we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite.” - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.9.13-14 (The Daily Stoic p.153)
- “‘Its better to plant the seeds of a few authors than to be scattered about by many.’ - Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 9.4; What if, when it came to your reading and learning, you prioritized quality over quantity?…Your shelves might be emptier, but your brain and your life would be fuller” The Daily Stoic, p.154
- Passion is vital to genius and intelligence. The more you love to learn, the more you will learn. The more you love about a topic, the more you’ll know about it.
- “Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius.” - Mozart
- Emotional Intelligence is a greater predictor of success than IQ. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html
- “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go” - Dr. Seuss, Oh, The Places You’ll Go
- “A scholar tries to learn something everyday; a student of Buddhism tries to unlearn something daily.” - Alan Watts (What bad habits, bad prejudices, bad notions do you hold? Unlearn them. Deleting code can be better than adding it. "Deleted code is debugged code." - Jeff Sickel)

### Make the World a Better Place
- Making the world a better place rests on making yourself a better person.
- You have concentric sphere’s of influence that decrease in your ability to enact change and good the farther from yourself you get. Focus on doing good in your most potent spheres of influence. Yourself is the closest sphere of influence.
- Give people the love and compassion they want, or the kind you want if nothing else. The Golden Rule.
- Do random acts of unsolicited kindness. it’ll make you feel better, but it will add good to the world.
- “…doing a kindness produces the single most reliable momentary increase in well-being of any exercise we have tested” - Martin Seligman, Flourish, as quoted in The Happiness Equation, p. 21
- “The quickest way, the surest way to find more happiness in our lives, is to focus on the happiness of others.” Chasing Happiness, Headsapce video, https://my.headspace.com/play/79
- “‘God laid down this law, saying: if you want some good, get it from yourself’ Epictetus, Discourses, 1.29.4 Here is how to guarantee you have a good day: do good things” The Daily Stoic, p.141
- “‘Kindness is invincible, but only when it’s sincere, with no hypocrisy or faking. For what can even the most malicious person do if you keep showing kindness and, if given the chance, you gently point out where they went wrong — right as they are trying to harm you?’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5.9a …The expected reaction to hatred is more hatred…Most rudeness, meanness, and cruelty are a mask for deep-seated weakness. Kindness in these situations is only possible for people of great strength. You have great strength. Use it.” The Daily Stoic p.146
- “What is your vocation? To be a good person.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.5 (TDS p.165)

### Be Judicious with Technology
- Technology takes you away from being present in the moment. Every moment you spend needlessly perusing your phone while your life happens around you, is a moment you miss, you don’t get to be part of, and one you don’t get back. I went through the car wash with 3-yr-old Nate. I have a vague memory of him bouncing excitedly back and forth in the car watching the scrubber and water go back and forth, but I was dialed into something unimportant on my phone, wasting time, and I missed that moment. I missed taking in his laughs, and laughing and engaging with him about something he was way into. And that’s the real problem, when you don’t engage with the people around you on stuff they see as important, you miss connecting with them and being there with them. You miss building memories. You’re not emphasizing experience in your life when you’re glued to your phone.
- Completely unplug regularly. It’s good for your mental health. It’ll keep you present
- Technology is there to serve you, not for you to be addicted to and escape and waste time. Learn how to be measured in your integration of technology in you life.
- “We’ve built a system that’s optimized for the absolute worst aspects of human behavior” https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=44&v=v9EKV2nSU8w
- https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2
- https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/conspiracies-climate-and-the-new-dark-age-an-extract-from-my-book-about-technology-and-the-end-2ffeef08ff29
- “Do you remember when only doctors had pagers?…Then suddenly everyone had pagers. Then everyone had cell phones. Now everyone is accessible, any way, any time…You need to remove access. Close the doors, lock the windows, answer the [one] bell [you’ve decided you’ll respond to]” The Happiness Equation, p. 198
- “We can find a retreat at any time by looking inward. We can sit with our eyes closed and feel our breath go in and out. We can turn on some music and tune out the world. We can turn off technology or shut off those rampant thoughts in our head. That will provide peace. Nothing else.” The Daily Stoic, p.91
- “‘The richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewal.’ …{The Power of Full Engagement}… A Kansas State University study found that complete downtime after work helps us recharge for the next day. Turning your phone off after dinner. Not using the internet on vacation.” The Happiness Equation, p.22
- Technology, at least in 2018, is really good at bringing out the worst tendencies in people: narcissism, greed, egoism, gossip, laziness. The way FB algorithms work, for example, is by giving you more of what you choose to view, and more often than not, what you choose to view appeals to your baser emotions like anger (e.g. an article about how the other political party is stupid). More often than not, technology feeds your sloth and rage and judgmental attitudes. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959
- Also, social media can lead to feelings of inadequacy and discouragement. You end up comparing your worst moments to peoples’ best moments.
- “With so much technology around us it’s really easy to forget we get to define our relationship with technology. We need to learn how to be a little less reactive and a little more responsive to every sound or vibration our phone makes” Headspace, Mindful Tech, Intro

## Quotes, etc.

#### _If_ — Rudyard Kipling
```
If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
```

#### _Leisure_, W. H. Davies
```
What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.
No time to stand beneath the boughs
And stare as long as sheep or cows.
No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.
No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.
No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance.
No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began.
A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.
```

### _Wandrers Nachtsong 1_
```
Der du von dem Himmel bist,
Alles Leid und Schmerzen stillest,
Den, der doppelt elend ist,
Doppelt mit Erquickung füllest;
Ach, ich bin des Treibens müde!
Was soll all der Schmerz und Lust?
Süßer Friede,
Komm, ach komm in meine Brust!
```

_Wandrers Nachtsong 2_
```
Über allen Gipfeln
Ist Ruh,
In allen Wipfeln
Spürest du
Kaum einen Hauch;
Die Vögelein schweigen im Walde.
Warte nur, balde
Ruhest du auch.
```

### “Bluebonnets in the Spring” Aaron Watson
```
In another time and place
Grandma would kiss my face
Wish I could go back there again
I'd climb up in my grandpa's lap
I'd lay down and take a nap
That old man and me were best friends

And one day I turned around
Leaves are fallin', fallin' down
Those fields were bare and brown and they were gone

Long gone like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul, so in the end
You won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring.

There's so much I can't explain
Such as gravity and pain
Still I remain, blindfolded and full of faith
I kissed my angel girl goodbye
Still can't help but wonder why
But I believe I'll see her again someday

So, hold 'em tender, hold 'em tight
Pray every mornin', day, and night
That God will help you raise them right
And don't you blink, don't blink

'Cause like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring

Life can be filled full of sorrow
Time is something you can't borrow
So love like there's no tomorrow
Because today could the day

Like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul, so in the end
You won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring
```


## Notes and Resources

### General
-Affiirmatons of Humanism-
We are committed to the application of reason and science to the understanding of the universe and to the solving of human problems.
We deplore efforts to denigrate human intelligence, to seek to explain the world in supernatural terms, and to look outside nature for salvation.
We believe that scientific discovery and technology can contribute to the betterment of human life.
We believe in an open and pluralistic society and that democracy is the best guarantee of protecting human rights from authoritarian elites and repressive majorities.
We are committed to the principle of the separation of church and state.
We cultivate the arts of negotiation and compromise as a means of resolving differences and achieving mutual understanding.
We are concerned with securing justice and fairness in society and with eliminating discrimination and intolerance.
We believe in supporting the disadvantaged and the handicapped so that they will be able to help themselves.
We attempt to transcend divisive parochial loyalties based on race, religion, gender, nationality, creed, class, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, and strive to work together for the common good of humanity.
We want to protect and enhance the earth, to preserve it for future generations, and to avoid inflicting needless suffering on other species.
We believe in enjoying life here and now and in developing our creative talents to their fullest.
We believe in the cultivation of moral excellence.
We respect the right to privacy. Mature adults should be allowed to fulfill their aspirations, to express their sexual preferences, to exercise reproductive freedom, to have access to comprehensive and informed health-care, and to die with dignity.
We believe in the common moral decencies: altruism, integrity, honesty, truthfulness, responsibility. Humanist ethics is amenable to critical, rational guidance. There are normative standards that we discover together. Moral principles are tested by their consequences.
We are deeply concerned with the moral education of our children. We want to nourish reason and compassion.
We are engaged by the arts no less than by the sciences.
We are citizens of the universe and are excited by discoveries still to be made in the cosmos.
We are skeptical of untested claims to knowledge, and we are open to novel ideas and seek new departures in our thinking.
We affirm humanism as a realistic alternative to theologies of despair and ideologies of violence and as a source of rich personal significance and genuine satisfaction in the service to others.
We believe in optimism rather than pessimism, hope rather than despair, learning in the place of dogma, truth instead of ignorance, joy rather than guilt or sin, tolerance in the place of fear, love instead of hatred, compassion over selfishness, beauty instead of ugliness, and reason rather than blind faith or irrationality.
We believe in the fullest realization of the best and noblest that we are capable of as human beings.


### Family
The things my patients say they'll miss the most are NOT seeing the World Landmarks, buying fancy things, that new car, "living it up" party style, etc. (https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/80dsy9/lpt_after_working_with_terminally_ill_cancer/)
Here is an actual compiled list:
* Watching my sons throw a baseball
* Listening to my grandparents tell stories
* My girlfriend surprising me with a kiss on the cheek
* Holding my wife in my arms knowing there's no where in the world I'd rather be
* Gram's Sunday dinners and the whole family getting together
* My dog
* Seeing my fiancé smile and feeling his arms wrap around me
* My daughter running to me when I get home
* The smell of flowers and rain
* The day I got married. I said I never would. And then I met her. And now I have to leave her.
* Smelling the fireplace on Christmas morning with the family
* All my friends
* Watching my family sleep
* The rush of weekday mornings. I know it sounds crazy, but I'll miss it. I'll miss the coffee, the crowded bathrooms, my wife's quick peck goodbye, the kids forgetting their lunch.. you get my point
* Rain. Is that weird?
....notice none of these things cost any money. They don't include technology. They're not grand gestures. It's human to human (or animals/nature) interaction, something we need more of in world that's becoming more fast paced and less human every day.


#### The Last Time (https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/7upwj7/damn/dtmjxlf/?sh=e4e4d783&st=JD63KIUB)
```
From the moment you hold your baby in your arms,
you will never be the same.
You might long for the person you were before,
When you have freedom and time,
And nothing in particular to worry about.
You will know tiredness like you never knew it before,
And days will run into days that are exactly the same,
Full of feedings and burping,
Nappy changes and crying,
Whining and fighting,
Naps or a lack of naps,
It might seem like a never-ending cycle.
But don’t forget …
There is a last time for everything.
There will come a time when you will feed
your baby for the very last time.
They will fall asleep on you after a long day
And it will be the last time you ever hold your sleeping child.
One day you will carry them on your hip then set them down,
And never pick them up that way again.
You will scrub their hair in the bath one night
And from that day on they will want to bathe alone.
They will hold your hand to cross the road,
Then never reach for it again.
They will creep into your room at midnight for cuddles,
And it will be the last night you ever wake to this.
One afternoon you will sing “the wheels on the bus” and do all the actions,
Then never sing them that song again.
They will kiss you goodbye at the school gate,
The next day they will ask to walk to the gate alone.
You will read a final bedtime story and wipe your last dirty face.
They will run to you with arms raised for the very last time.
The thing is, you won’t even know it’s the last time
Until there are no more times.
And even then, it will take you awhile to realize.
So while you are living in these times,
remember there are only so many of them
and when they are gone, you will yearn for just one more day of them.
For one last time.

#### My adopted take on the family:
- we believe marriage between people who love each other is a good thing
- families are unique and diverse
- no family looks the same and that is okay
- all human beings, male and female and everyone in between, are awesome
- gender is personal, sometimes it’s complicated, sometimes it is not we respect all expressions of gender
- intimacy is an expression of affection between people who love each other and is nobody’s business
- parents have a responsibility to:
    - provide for their child’s physical, emotional and spiritual welfare, love their child without condition or constraint
    - teach their child how to love themselves
    - teach their child how to love others
- by design parents are equal parters, together, they preside, provide, protect, nurture, nourish
- families are established and maintained on principles of love, compassion, respect, trust, honesty, and integrity
- our family is inherently beautiful


## The Problem with Religion
...is that it takes good and useful truths and attaches them to God. These truths can stand on their own - Sam Harris

### Top 3 Reasons (including links and examples) I left the Mormon church:
To me, these things are dangerous and harmful, and if they’re true, then the church isn’t. God wouldn’t do it this way; yes men are flawed, but God is perfect, so he could and should help his men avoid these pitfalls.
1. information suppression, whitewashing, gaslighting, rhetorical control, ideological rigidity, historical revisionism (mostly about church history, but it applies currently as well), technophobia - the church wants to control information, god would have no need for this

2. The Church runs more like a Business (Jesus Christ Inc.) than a religion  - the lds version of corporatism- for all their claim to neutrality they sure love to take up stake in politics. But they are also shrewd businessmen, getting their fingers into any profitable pie they can. They're basically just another copy of a lobbying, conservative corporation, it shows in their business dealings and in their stances. Doesn't seem very Christlike, and it doesn't seem like something the “true and living church of Christ” would have need for

3. Cultural oppression - treatment of women, minorities, homosexuals, other nationalities - gaslighting members - manipulation of exmormons, pushing homogeneity
    - The most christlike person i can think of in modern history isn’t even mormon: Fred Rogers. And weirdly enough, none of the church leaders comes across near as christlike as Mr. Rogers. I would expect them to, bring Jesus’ servants. They do not exude christlike love and acceptance to everyone the way Mr. Rogers did.
    - The church should be a light-years-ahead leader on social issues, given their assumed divine guidance, but instead they often lag behind the advancement of social issues (e.g. https://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng “The justifications for this restriction echoed the widespread ideas about racial inferiority”, https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/89uzrg/dont_forget_that_it_was_10_years_after_ml_kings/?st=JFM3QTUN&sh=d3469adc)
    - “I am thinking about how much we do for so few and how little we do for so many. The tithing of the people I just visited in South America and from good people all over the world paid for this facility. And most of the people who have made this beautiful facility possible will never see or step foot in a building like this. That is what I am thinking about.” (Henry B. Eyeing) http://idahostatejournal.com/members/lds-apostle-delivers-warning-promise-at-byu-idaho-campus/article_2db6c1d8-6216-5718-b69e-7cc95491495b.html

4. Bonus: The Church and Social Progress - The church should be a thought leader on love and acceptance with the Master of love and acceptance leading them; but they are never on the forefront of social issues that turn out to be objectively, demonstrably good for everyone. This runs counter to the way you’d expect from God’s true church.
    - Civial Rights for Blacks (specifically priesthood, interracial marrying, etc, used to be widely frowned upon and preached against in the church as a very bad thing. It wasn’t until BYU was about to lose accreditation in the 70s that the church finally came around and removed the priesthood ban)
    - Gay Acceptance (They are not accepting, they are more than just indifferent, they are actively tormenting the individuals that would actually like to be part of their church by classifying homosexuality as apostasy (https://www.lds.org/church/news/elder-christofferson-says-handbook-changes-regarding-same-sex-marriages-help-protect-children?lang=eng&_r=1), but not adultery or murder, wtf? plus the children of homosexual parents who wish to be baptized must wait until they are 18 and then fully disavow their gay parents)
    - Medical Marijuana (It’s better than alcohol, but you don’t see them trying to bring back Prohibition) https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2018/05/11/mormon-church-compiles-legal-issues-with-medical-marijuana-initiative-but-still-doesnt-explicitly-oppose-it/
    - Empowering and truly equalizing women (https://i.redd.it/dl64zujbbqp01.jpg, https://i.redd.it/4meec69b88q01.jpg, https://i.redd.it/jly3f26o88q01.jpg, https://i.redd.it/h1qt6e777fp01.jpg, https://i.redd.it/ph8tob3ma1o01.jpg, https://i.redd.it/7tfuhd7kgln01.jpg, https://i.redd.it/16yjvev7a1o01.jpg, https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/5lopnr/the_church_used_my_body_as_currency/?st=JG1I088Y&sh=3a0b49a3)
    - They don’t actually provide that much humanitarian aid around the world (https://i.redd.it/2tja1dmkgfp01.jpg, the Seventh Day Adventists give more percent-wise than the LDS church does; they earn less  and give more)
    - The church doesn’t use much of its money to give aid http://followtheprophets.com/tithing-money/

“It was lonely to unravel. But more than that, it simply hurts to unbecome, to feel the ideological foundation of life ripping apart.” “Disabuse rarely visits like the tooth fairy, taking away your rotted belief system and leaving you a shiny new one in its place. It takes years of collapsing and years of rebuilding.”

### My occams razor conclusion: The church's truth claims are patently, demonstrably false; it is not led by God, but by regular men (who happen to be moral traditionalists), pushing their own ideology (as well as covering up past versions of this ideology)

“So you have to ask yourself. What’s more likely? That {JS} plagiarized the Book of Mormon and copied the free masons temple ceremony to get money. And that polygamy was because he was a pervert.
Or that it’s from God and his most important use of an angel and a flaming sword was to get Joseph to marry a young girl. And the Book of Mormon just happens to be historically inaccurate and plagiarized and the temple just happens to be very similar to Masonry.
If you allow yourself to consider that it could not be true and just look at the evidence from all sides it gets clear really fast.” - Steph

#### “Anti-Mormon" literature
1. A couple’s story: cites and summarizes all the church linked essays: https://whyweleft.wordpress.com/
2. Translation of BoA https://www.lds.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng - BoA is bogus, the Abraham papyrus is nonsense
3. BOM translation procedure different from traditional portrayals and teaching https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng&_r=1 - used seer stone instead of U&T and plates: “Apparently for convenience, Joseph often translated with the single seer stone rather than the two stones bound together to form the interpreters … Most of the accounts speak of Joseph’s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone), and many accounts refer to his use of a single stone. According to these accounts, Joseph placed either the interpreters or the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.” ‘She described Joseph “sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us. According to Emma, the plates “often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth.”’ Harris later related that as Joseph used the seer stone to translate, sentences appeared. Joseph read those sentences aloud, and after penning the words, Harris would say, “Written.” An associate who interviewed Harris recorded him saying that Joseph “possessed a seer stone, by which he was enabled to translate as well as from the Urim and Thummim, and for convenience he then used the seer stone.”
