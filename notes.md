Top 3

# Top 3 Important Things to Me
This is a long rundown of what I think is important in life. First there are the 3 things in my life that are most important to me; my purpose and meaning. Next is all the things I think are important when answering “How do you live a good life?” It’s made up of mostly stoic ideals and mindfulness practices. The very bottom is all the reasons I left the mormon church, and therefore the reason I wrote this.

1. Family
    * Prioritize close, personal relationships (family, close friends, etc)
        *  Foster a loving, supportive, compassionate relationship with my kids and my wife. I want to be part of their life forever. Make the time we have together count.
            * I think fostering this relationship means more than just love. Love is the necessary foundation, and gives you the appreciation to enjoy the journey, but only love is a disservice since it can lead to permissiveness, timidity and enabling. The other part of being a good father, is actually being something for your kids. They need to be guided, helped, and directed, mostly by example. The best dads are the ones that combine deep, unconditional love for their family with a steady, firm example of who to be and how to live. That’s where the rest of this comes in. (‘For I believe a good king is from the outset and by necessity a philosopher, and the philosopher is from the outset a kingly person’ -Musonius Rufus, Lectures, 8.33.32-34; TDS p.206; “Can you be a source of strength and inspiration to others around you? That’s Stoic joy - the joy that comes from purpose, excellence, and duty.” TDS p.227)
            * The goal of good parenting isn’t to have happy kids, that’s an occasional side effect. The end goal is to have happy adults.
        * Enjoy the moment, appreciate the time you have with your kids https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/80dsy9/lpt_after_working_with_terminally_ill_cancer/?st=JE4OAY9Q&sh=bab60a62
            *
        * Remember, one day you pick your kid up and you’ll put him down for the last time https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/7upwj7/comment/dtmjxlf?st=JD63KIUB&sh=e4e4d783
        * “Happy people are committed to making time for and enjoying friends and family. They have people they count on and trust.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
        * “Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else” - Uncle Iroh
        * Appreciate the time you have with your loved ones. “Nell teaches aspects of parenthood never understood before. If she cries or makes a mess or decides to be contrary (and these are relatively rare), it doesn’t bother. There is always Chris’s silence to compare it to.” - Robert Pirsig, ZatAoMM
        * Remember your kids aren’t you. They’re their own people. You’re helping them find their own way, not redo yours.
            * “Whenever you kiss your child, don’t layer on top of the experience all the things you might wish…Remind yourself that your precious one isn’t one of your possessions, but something given for now, not forever…” - Epictetus, Discourses, 3.24.84-86a (TDS p.349)
        * Getting mad at people for making mistakes doesn’t teach them to not make mistakes, it teaches them to hide them
        * “When little ones get overwhelmed by big emotions it’s our job to share our calm, not join in their chaos” L.R. Knost
        * There are three parts to raising kids, as I see it, and the important pivot in parent comes at adulthood when you stop doing the first 2 and are executing mostly on the last one. The tricky part is that you more or less dictate 1 and 2, but they dictate 3 and you need to be in tune with their needs and wants for that.
            * 1. Teach them how to do stuff (e.g. eat, walk, talk, ride a bike, do math, etc)
                * give them independence, more autonomy, less supervision https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoXpNJLFngc
            * 2. Teach them what to be (e.g. morality, behavior, hard work, manners, etc)
            * 3. Provide emotional support, validation, unconditional love, compassion, empathy, listening ear, encouragement
    * Raise my children to be thoughtful, empathetic, enlightened people, capable of finding their own positive value in life, and contributing to the betterment of others
2. Fulfillment - Personal, Professional, and Creative
    * Emphasize experience and memories over possessions and material goods; reduce waste
        * Just spending and enjoying time with my family

        * Other Invigorating leisure activities
        * Skiing
        * Mtn biking
        * Photography
    * Either be improving life or enjoying it (“Make sure you enjoy your relaxation like a poet — not idly, but actively” TDS.p288)
        * Having fun is good for you
    * Take pride in and control of my life, make it what i want as far as i am able, don’t let other people/institutions dictate my way of life
        * Live according to my family’s wants and needs, as well as my own.
        * Discipline
    * Find fulfilling work; try to do things for work that add net benefit to mankind or provide meaningful fulfillment personally
    * Taking care of my life, fixing the house, doing yard and house projects, etc
    * Studying, reading, learning, and building good character
    * Be fiscally literate so that me and my immediate family are comfortable
        * extra can go to compassionately and generously optimizing the human condition within my sphere of influence

    * Physical exercise
        * Be physically fit, healthy, and improve longevity of the life i do have.

            * “Happy people pay attention to the good in others and the things that are going right…interpret other people and events around them in a positive light, and see opportunities and possibilities. And they take time to remember and be grateful for the good things in their lives.“
            * “Positive emotions that connect you to things larger than yourself boost happiness: awe, gratitude, thanksgiving, wonder at the universe, seeing beauty outside yourself.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
        * Social connections
            * See no. 1

# Moral Paradigm & How I Should Live My Life
## Beliefs
* Peace of Mind is a Meaningful, Basic Pursuit and is foundational for individual Happiness and Health
    * Literally a mind at peace, free from worry and turbulence; a healthy, contented mind
    * Whether one pursues peace of mind for self gratification, or for altruistic reasons, benefits abound
    * “We May live with the idea that we should always be happy, but this is not the nature of life. In accepting this simple truth, we discover a greater sense of ease in more challenging times. In many ways this is the heart of so much of our stress, our struggle, our discontent in life, to have this idea that life should always be happy. It’s a really strong idea, and there’s a lot of desire behind that idea, but we never really pause to think, is that even possible? Is that even appropriate, is that what we would want in our life? Reactively, we would assume that, yes, of course, we would, but when we’re going through a difficult time, if somebody close to us is unwell, do we necessarily want to be happy during that time? IF we lose someone close to us, would we want to be happy? The truth is the range of human emotion supports us throughout the journey, and throughout the many different circumstances that arise. We’re not always in a position in a given situation where happiness, in terms of the happiness that we think of as not feeling sad, is not necessarily appropriate. We can then perhaps talk about a contentment, or a sense of ease, that exists beyond, or beneath, that everyday happiness, that is with us in those times of happiness, but it’s also with us in those times of sadness. It’s a mind which is at ease with thinking, at ease with feelings, at ease with the world around us, no matter how it appears in that moment. It doesn’t mean that we necessarily want it to be that way, but at the same time, we’re not resisting it, and in not resisting it, we find a sense of contentment. So rather than striving for that everyday kind of happiness, and looking outward for that, looking inward and finding that sense of contentment, no matter how the mind or life appears in any given moment.”-Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Challenging times,” Monday January 14, 2019
    * “When people say that stoics are dour or depressive, they’re really missing the point. Who cares if someone is bubbly when times are good? what kind of accomplishment is that? But can you be fully content with your life, can you bravely face what life has in store from one day to the next, can you bounce back from every kind of adversity without losing a step, can you be a source of strength and inspiration to others around you? That’s Stoic joy - the joy that comes from purpose, excellence, and duty.” TDS p.227
* Purposeful, Mindful Engagement in the Present Moment is Central to Happiness and Peace of Mind
* Meaning and Purpose are Central to Happiness and Peace of Mind
    * Individually Created
    * Derived from a strong sense of who you are (developed from self-love)
    * Derived from the notion that your time is finite, and your part in nature
* An Internal Locus of Control is Central to Happiness and Peace of Mind
    * You only Control your Thoughts, Attitudes, and Outlook
    * Self Love is a really good way to begin to develop internal control
    * State of mind dictates happiness, not circumstances
    * Intrinsic motivation is the best motivation (e.g. doing it for you according to your purpose in life)
    * Happiness is in your control, and comes first.
    * You bring meaning to circumstances and occurrences
    * Circumstances won’t make you happy. You breed happiness within yourself, regardless of circumstance.
    * Presence in the moment is vital to happiness and enjoyment
    * Tranquility of mind is preferable to a turbulent mind
    * Seeing the good in life, and being grateful helps avoid the scourge of stress
* Love is a Basic Human Need and contributes to Peace of Mind
    * Compassion and Love for Yourself is Foundational
    * Most people need Connection with Others
    * Altruism and Compassion for others is a part of the need for Love
    * Takes Work to Keep Healthy (Boundaries)
    * Love People, Use Things. Not the other way around
    * Pragmatically, Humans Rely Heavily on Each Other (No Man is an Island)
* Any Direction in Life, Purposefully Chosen, is Better than a Default, Unchosen Direction
* Experiences and Memories are more Fulfilling than Possessions and Material Goods
* A Slow, Simple, Focused Life is Preferable to a Fast, Complex, Scattered One
* Have fun
* Be good
* Enough is Preferable to More
* Action is Better than Analysis
* You only get one body and one life, appreciate and care for them
* The Earth is the only home humanity has and it should be cared for
* Technology is both a Powerful Ally and a Dangerous Enemy, Requires Awareness

 “’I’ll never be ashamed to quote a bad writer with a good saying’ -Seneca, On Tranquility, 11.8 Who cares if some bit of wisdom is from a stoic, who cares whether it perfectly jibes with Stoicism? What matters is whether it makes your life better, whether it makes you better.” TDS p.253

### Discover the Meaning in Nature and Death
- “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2
- “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 2.11
- Death is one of Nature’s constants, learning to find your place in nature is learning to accept the impermanence of your life.
- “In a short time you’ll be nobody and nowhere, even as the great emperors Hadrian and Augustus are now.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.5 (The Daily Stoic, p.162)
- “Think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead man, see what’s left as a bonus and live it according to Nature. Love the hand that fate deals you and play it as your own, for what could be more fitting?” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
- “It’s not until they tell you you’re going to die soon that you realize how short life is. Time is the most valuable thing in life because it never comes back. And whether you spend it in the arms of a loved one or alone in a prison-cell, life is what you make of it. Dream big.” - Stefan Stefansson
- “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.” - Gandalf, LOTR
- “Im not ready” - “No one ever is. We don't get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning, to know our days are numbered, your time is short.” - Dr. Strange and the Ancient One, in Dr. Strange
- Objectively, empirically, we are given this life and that’s it. Maybe there’s an afterlife, but we can’t prove that. Therefore, objectively speaking, all we can do is make the life we’re sure we have count for ourselves.
- “Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” -Macbeth
- “’We are like many pellets of incense falling on the same altar. Some collapse sooner, others later, but it makes no difference.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.15 Measuring ourselves against other people makes acceptance difficult, because we want what they have, or we want how things could have gone, not what we happen to have. But that makes no difference…We’re all here and we’re all going to leave this earth eventually, so let’s not concern ourselves with the petty differences in the meantime. We have too much to do.” TDS p.351
- ”Knowing the truth, which is that nothing matters, can actually save you in those moments. Once you get through that terrifying threshold of accepting that, then every place is the center of the universe, and every moment is the most important moment, and everything is the meaning of life." Dan Harmon, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de2grEPn7rg
- “We must make ready for death before we make ready for life. Life is well enough furnished, but we are too greedy with regard to its furnishings; something always seems to us lacking, and will always seem lacking. To have lived long enough depends neither upon our years nor upon our days, but upon our minds.” -Seneca
- Memento Mori - accept your eventual, but inevitable death as part of life
- “You rarely have time for everything you want in this life, so you need to make choices. And hopefully your choices come from a deep sense of who you are” - Fred Rogers
- ’Never shirk the proper dispatch of your duty, no matter if you are freezing or hot, groggy or well-rested, vilified or praised, not even if dying or pressed by other demands. Even dying is one of the important assignments of life and, in this as in all else, make the most of your resources to do well the duty at hand.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.2 (TDS p199)
- “I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.” #1 regret of dying people, reported by EoL nurse in The Guardian
- “I have long since thought that the mentality we encounter a lot "you only live once" is really empty. You try desperately to do as much as you can while racing the proverbial hourglass and it turns into this race to nowhere. It seems sad because in a way the more you deceive yourself into thinking you could ever live enough life seems to make life go by faster and faster. I prefer to accept the finite nature, embrace that we are witnessing a glimpse of existence, and then every moment seems more meaningful. I don't need to be constantly doing something new and exciting to enjoy my life. It’s always an uphill battle to keep life simple, to find time to watch a sunset or look at the stars or just become present in the moment. And then there's those people who actively rush through life, chasing every new adventure, not realizing that they are running in place. TL:DR I guess what I am trying to say is human life it too short to make it about quantity but we can certainly make it about quality.” https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/93d0xh/comment/e3cvurp?st=JKARA06V&sh=f7e3420a
- Zeek: “I know what it’s like though, you got a house full of kids, you got no money coming in, and you feel like you’re in the middle of things, and you’re being pushed and pulled in different directions.” Crosby: “Exactly” Zeek: “Well, you got to…you got to try to enjoy it, son, you know? Have a little fun, and scare the bear. It just goes by fast.” - Parenthood, S6E5, 35:00
- “We all sorely complain of the shortness of time, and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives are either spent in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to do. We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.” -Seneca
- “We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.” Confucius
- “None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death. The capital T Truth is about life before death.” - David Foster Wallace, This is Water
- “If you’re like most people, you’ll spend most of your time in life tacitly presuming you’ll live forever. It’s like watching a bad movie for the fourth time, or bickering with your spouse, these things only make sense in light of eternity. There better be a heaven if I’m going to waste my time like this.” Sam Harris, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI3a5m-lFVg 19:25
- “’When you see someone often flashing their rank or position…don’t be envious; such things are often bought at the expense of life…The few that make it to the top of their ambition through a thousand indignities realize at the end it’s only for an inscription on their gravestone.’ -Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 20 Workaholics always make excuses for their selfishness. While these attitudes can lead to impressive accomplishments, their cost is rarely justified. The ability to work hard and long is admirable. But you are a human being, not a human doing. Seneca points out that we’re not animals. ‘Is it really so pleasant to die in a harness?’ he asked. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn put it better: ‘Work is what horses die of. Everyone should know that.’” TDS p.222
- “Is there really so little meaning in your life that your only pursuit is to work until you’re eventually carted off in a coffin? Take pride in your work, but it is not all.” TDS p.228
- “After all, what's a life, anyway? We're born, we live a little while, we die.” - E.B. White, Charlotte’s Web
- “‘Show me that the good life doesn’t consist in its length, but in its use, and that it is possible — no, entirely too common — for a person who has had a long life to have lived too little’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 49.10b Show yourself. That no matter how many years you’re ultimately given, your life can be clearly and earnestly said to have been a long and full one.” The Daily Stoic, p.157
- “‘Let each thing you would do, say or intend be like that of a dying person.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.11.1 You already have a terminal diagnosis. We all do! As the writer Edmund Wilson puts it: ‘Death is one prophecy that never fails. Every person is born with a death sentence. Each second that passes is one you’ll never get back…Don’t let another day tick away in ignorance of the reality that you’re a dying person.” TDS p.358
- "...we all die, and our respect for death should always lead us to have an appreciation for life rather than a paranoid existence." - Sam Harris
- “A better analogy would be a soldier about to leave on deployment. Not knowing whether they’ll return or not, what do they do? They get their affairs in order. They handle their business. They tell their children or their family that they love them. They don’t have time for quarreling or petty matters. An they in the morning they are ready to go  — hoping to come back in one piece but prepared for the possibility that they might now. Let us live today that same way.” TDS p.257
- The irony of death and the cold, uncaring universe is that by locating yourself inside it, you can find a sense of awe, wonder, and gratitude.
- Nature is grounding. Like the breath. When you look at nature, it’s stillness and permanence can be a foundation for finding calm and relieving stress and worry. You can let that go as you take in the shapes and the sounds and the colors that exist in the natural world. You can watch as it moves on, uncaring of the things that weighed so heavily on your mind and you gain perspective, and you’re grounded.
- “Sometimes we might be fearful of death, assuming it’s radically different to life. But like a beautiful wave, eventually it has to return to the ocean. In truth, they were never separate at all. We all have a different relationship with this idea of life or death, and there are so many things that feed into that, …{but} finding a degree of comfort with the reality of our impermanence is actually a really important part of living life fully, and enjoying our life as it is. The temptation is to see it as black and white, as two different things, but this idea of the ocean is really helpful. We look out at the ocean, and there’s real pleasure in seeing a wave emerge out of the ocean, in watching it unfold, in watching it travel. Each and every single wave is different. It has its own root, its own direction. And there’s something about the way that that wave is expressed that makes it unique. And yet, ultimately, each and every wave goes back into the ocean. But the wave hasn’t been lost; the water is still the same, it’s just gone back into the ocean. It’s come from the ocean, it’s gone back into the ocean. Something beautiful has been expressed, and yet nothing has been lost. Remembering this idea can bring a greater sense of peace to the mind and to our life.” Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Life and Death” Monday, July 9, 2018
- “‘The human being is born with an inclination toward virtue’ - Musonius Rufus, Lectures, 2.7.1-2 We’re made to help each other and be good to each other. We wouldn’t have survived as a species otherwise…You were born with an attraction to virtue and self-mastery. If you’ve gotten far from that, it’s not out of some inborn corruption but from a nurturing of the wrong things and the wrong ideas. As Seneca has pointed out, philosophy is a tool to strip it all away and get back to our true nature.” TDS p.324 — Basically, to me, this means that at the bottom of all our meaning and purpose is the purpose Nature gave us in the beginning: to be a good person. Kierkegaard’s lily of the field and bird is similar to this: they don’t worry about what they are or what their purpose is, they just are, a lily and a bird and that’s enough. That’s the foundation of purpose and meaning for people too: be a good human being. Any purpose beyond that is great, not bad or to be avoided, but it is extra.
- “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2
- “Nature has intermingled pleasure with necessary things – not in order that we should seek pleasure, but in order that the addition of pleasure may make the indispensable means of existence attractive to our eyes.” - Seneca, Moral Letters, 116.3
- “Of all the paths you take in life, make sure some of them are dirt.” John Muir
- “‘Watch the stars in their courses and imagine yourself running alongside them. Think constantly on the changes of the elements into each other, for such thoughts wash away the dust of earthly life.’ Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.47…Given that we’re in our bodies every day, it’s tempting to think that’s the most important thing in the world. But we counteract that bias by looking at nature—at things much bigger than us. A line from Seneca, which has since become a proverb, expresses Marcus’s insight well: The world itself is a huge temple of the gods. Looking at the beautiful expanse of the sky is an antidote to the nagging pettiness of earthly concerns. And it is good and sobering to lose yourself in that as often as you can.” The Daily Stoic, p.131
- Life is an expression of the universe. “You are an aperture through which the universe is looking at and exploring itself.” - Alan Watts; “We are a way for the cosmos to know itself” - Carl Sagan
- “The universe is change. Life is opinion.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.3.4b
- As long as you live with purpose and pursue it, your life is beautifully expressed and nothing is lost.
- “The meaning of life is to give something meaning”
- “What’s the meaning of life? Why was I born?…As Viktor Frankl points out in Man’s Search for Meaning, it is not our question to ask. Instead, it is we who are being asked the question. It’s our lives that are the answer. No amount of travel or reading or clever sages can tell you what you want to know. Instead, it is you who must find the answer in your actions, in living the good life — by embodying the self-evident principles of justice, self-control, courage, freedom, and abstaining from evil.” TDS p.313
- “I don't think an ancient Stoic would ever really consider the question of his or her life's meaning. You're part of nature; that's your meaning. Sure, you're also part of a family and of a society, too, but even if you were cast alone on an island, the meaningfulness of your life would just never be in question.” https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/8z3b20/comment/e2gfpzm?st=JJNSXYQO&sh=7470a6dc
- “The Stoics believed that every person, animal, and thing has a purpose or a place in nature. Even in ancient Greek and Roman times, they vaguely understood that the world was composed of millions of tiny atoms. It was this idea — this sense of an interconnected cosmos — that underpinned their sense that every person and every action was part of a larger system. Everyone had a job — a specific duty.” TDS p198
- “‘Whenever you have trouble getting up in the morning, remind yourself that you’ve been made by nature for the purpose of working with others, whereas even unthinking animals share sleeping. and it’s our own natural purpose that is more fitting and more satisfying.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.12 According to the Stoics, we humans have a higher obligation — not the gods, but to each other….Civilization and country are great projects that we build together and have been building together with our ancestors for millennia. We are made for cooperation (synergy) with each other…Your purpose is to help us render this great work together.” TDS p.218

- “[Hike]…I don't like either the word or the thing. People ought to saunter in the mountains - not hike! Do you know the origin of that word 'saunter?' It's a beautiful word. Away back in the Middle Ages people used to go on pilgrimages to the Holy Land, and when people in the villages through which they passed asked where they were going, they would reply, "A la sainte terre,' 'To the Holy Land.' And so they became known as sainte-terre-ers or saunterers. Now these mountains are our Holy Land, and we ought to saunter through them reverently, not 'hike' through them." - John Muir
- “‘The unjust person acts against the gods. For insofar as the nature of the universe made rational creatures for the sake of each other…anyone breaking nature’s will obviously acts against the oldest of gods’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.1.1 We say of the most heinous acts that they are crimes against nature …our sense of justice goes marrow deep….The key, then, is to support our natural inclination to justice with strong boundaries and strong commitments — to embrace, as Lincoln urged a divided, angry nation to do, ‘the better angels of our nature.’” TDS p.217 — Living according to nature is to live a just, virtuous life.

    Der du von dem Himmel bist,

-  _Leisure_, W. H. Davies
    ```
    What is this life if, full of care,
    We have no time to stand and stare.
    No time to stand beneath the boughs
    And stare as long as sheep or cows.
    No time to see, when woods we pass,
    Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.
    No time to see, in broad daylight,
    Streams full of stars, like skies at night.
    No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
    And watch her feet, how they can dance.
    No time to wait till her mouth can
    Enrich that smile her eyes began.
    A poor life this if, full of care,
    We have no time to stand and stare.
    ```

### Live Life with Purpose
- “First tell yourself what kind of person you want to be, then do what you have to do” -Epictetus, Discourses, 3.23.1-2a The Daily Stoic, p.136. Loving yourself helps you gain a sense of who you are and who you want to be, which must come before you can find your meaning and purpose in life. I think if you try living a purpose without knowing yourself (i.e. your wants and drives), this will just cause stress.
- “What’s the meaning of life? Why was I born?…As Viktor Frankl points out in Man’s Search for Meaning, it is not our question to ask. Instead, it is we who are being asked the question. It’s our lives that are the answer. No amount of travel or reading or clever sages can tell you what you want to know. Instead, it is you who must find the answer in your actions, in living the good life — by embodying the self-evident principles of justice, self-control, courage, freedom, and abstaining from evil.” TDS p.313
- “It’s a moral obligation to pursue what you find meaningful. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. It might require sacrifice  ….First, imagine you were taking care of yourself like you were someone you cared for. Then, if you could have what you needed and wanted, what would it be? What sort of friends would you have? What would your family relationships look like? How would you conduct yourself with your children? How would you educate yourself? You need to think through how it is that your life could be properly arranged if you had that ability. And then you can aim at that. If you do posit a goal of that sort, and work toward it, you will move towards it. The goal will change, because you’ll learn things along the way…Things inevitably get better for people {following this pattern}. It’s not a luxury, its difficult, it’s a moral responsibility. It isn’t happiness, the pursuit isn’t for happiness, it’s to pursue what is meaningful. ” -Jordan Peterson

- “You rarely have time for everything you want in this life, so you need to make choices. And hopefully your choices come from a deep sense of who you are” - Fred Rogers
- “Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it’s to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential — as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth. You’ll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you’re doing. There are a million ways to sell yourself out, and I guarantee you’ll hear about them. To invent your own life’s meaning is not easy, but it’s still allowed, and I think you’ll be happier for the trouble.” - Bill Waterson
- “Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.” -Gandhi
- “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

- Once you’ve found your reason for being, always live true to it and pursue it.
- ”Knowing the truth, which is that nothing matters, can actually save you in those moments. Once you get through that terrifying threshold of accepting that, then every place is the center of the universe, and every moment is the most important moment, and everything is the meaning of life."

- Find what matters to you. Find out what enjoying and being fulfilled by life means to you. This will give you your purpose in life, your ikigai.
- Make sure it doesn’t hurt anyone
- Either be improving life or enjoying it
- Find who you are and love yourself for it.

- Die with memories not dreams
- “Retirement, as we think of it today, isn’t a dream we actually want. We don’t actually want to do nothing. We just want to do something we love.” The Happiness Equation, p. 123. You need a hobby, a creative outlet, but more than that you need to be fulfilled.
- “Life without design is erratic. As soon as one is in place, principles become necessary.” - Seneca, Moral Letters, 95.46; The Daily Stoic, p.98
- Be something. Anything. It can change, but just pick. This is your anchor, your foundation, it’s what you come back to and how you help make sense of the world and what you push for for yourself and your interests. Run with it until you need to adapt or adjust it, and make sure your always open to adjusting it, not always adjusting it, but just open to adjusting it if you need to. “When we do not express ourselves, do not assert our being, do not stand up for our values in contexts where it is appropriate to do so, we inflict wounds on our sense of self. The world does not do it to us - we do it to ourselves.” The Six Pillars of Self-esteem, p 124
- “Like bluebonnets in the spring, We're only here for a little while. It's beautiful and bittersweet, So make the most of every mile. So pack light and love heavy, Give it all your heart and soul, so in the end You won't regret one thing” - “Bluebonnets in the Spring” Aaron Watson
- “’Show me that the good life doesn’t consist in its length, but in its use’” the Daily Stoic, p.157
- It’s possible to have a short life that is full, it’s possible to have a long life that is empty. The number of years you get doesn’t matter, just how you fill them up. “‘Show me that the good life doesn’t consist in its length, but in its use, and that it is possible — no, entirely too common — for a person who has had a long life to have lived too little’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 49.10b Show yourself. That no matter how many years you’re ultimately given, your life can be clearly and earnestly said to have been a long and full one.” The Daily Stoic, p.157
- The flood irrigation principle: when using a shovel to irrigate a field, you can’t just make dams everywhere you don’t want water to go. It’s more effective to give the water somewhere to go. The interesting subtlety is that the water will go somewhere whether you like it or not, it’s just up to you to decide where.
- “‘Work nourishes noble minds’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 31.5 …The mind and the body are there to be used — they turn on themselves when not put to some productive end. It’s sad to think that this kind of frustration is an everyday reality for a lot of people…Worse is when we try to push these feelings away by buying things, going out, fighting, creating drama — indulging in the empty calories of existence instead of finding the real nourishment. The solution is simple and, thankfully, always right at hand. Get out there and work.” TDS, p.163
- “To what service is my soul committed? Constantly ask yourself this and thoroughly examine yourself by seeing how you relate to that part called the ruling principle.” - Marcus Aurelius Meditations, 5.11 (TDS 213)
- “‘Don’t await the perfection of Plato’s Republic, but be satisfied with even the smallest step forward and regard the outcome as a small thing’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.29.(4) The idea is not to settle or compromise your standards, but rather not to become trapped by idealism…Do what you can now” TDS p.237
- “Don’t forget to ask: ‘is this really the life I want?’ Every time you get upset, a little life leaves the body. Are these really the things on which you want to spend that priceless resource?” The Daily Stoic, p.52
- “Philosophy is not some idle pursuit appropriate only for academics or the rich. Instead, it is one of the most essential activities that a human being can engage in…You’re not reading these quotes and doing these thought exercises for fun. Though they may be enjoyable and help you lighten up, their aim is to help you sculpt and improve your life. And because all of us have but one life and one death, we should treat each experience like a sculptor with chisels, carving until, to paraphrase Michelangelo, we set free the angel in the marble” TDS p.359

### Live Life on Purpose
- “‘First tell yourself what kind of person you want to be, then do what you have to do’ -Epictetus, Discourses, 3.23.1-2a … An archer is unlikely to hit a target she did not aim for” The Daily Stoic, p.136
- “It’s a moral obligation to pursue what you find meaningful. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. It might require sacrifice  ….First, imagine you were taking care of yourself like you were someone you cared for. Then, if you could have what you needed and wanted, what would it be? What sort of friends would you have? What would your family relationships look like? How would you conduct yourself with your children? How would you educate yourself? You need to think through how it is that your life could be properly arranged if you had that ability. And then you can aim at that.

The goal will change, because you’ll learn things along the way…Things inevitably get better for people {following this pattern}. It’s not a luxury, its difficult, it’s a moral responsibility. It isn’t happiness, the pursuit isn’t for happiness, it’s to pursue what is meaningful. ” -Jordan Peterson
- “‘The attention you give to any action should be in due proportion to its worth.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.32b Don’t spend your time (the most valuable and least renewable of all your resources) on things that don’t matter. What about the things that don’t matter but you’re absolutely obligated to do? Well, spend as little time and worry on them as possible. If you give things more time and energy than they deserve, they’re no longer lesser things. You’ve made them important by the life you’ve spent on them. And sadly, you’ve made the important things — your family, your health, your true commitments — less so as a result of what you’ve stolen from them.“ TDS p.251
- “You rarely have time for everything you want in this life, so you need to make choices. And hopefully your choices come from a deep sense of who you are” - Fred Rogers
- “Chaos ensues from not having a plan. Not because plans are perfect, but because people without plans - like a line of infantry without a strong leader - are much more likely to get overwhelmed and fall apart.” The Daily Stoic, p.98
- “If a man knows not to which port he sails, no wind is favorable” -Seneca
- “Evaluate what you are doing, why you are doing it, and where accomplishing it will take you. If you don’t have a good answer, then stop” -Epictetus, Discourses, 4.4.41; 43 (TDS p.164)
- “As we examine our past behavior, it’s sad how often we find this to be the case - that we were not acting consciously or deliberately but instead by forces we did not bother to evaluate.” The Daily Stoic, p.100
- “An archer is unlikely to hit a target she did  not aim for…our perceptions and principles guide us in the selection of what we want—but ultimately our actions determine whether we get there or not. So yes, spend some time—real, uninterrupted time—thinking about what’s important to you, what your priorities are. Then, work toward that and forsake all others. It’s not enough to wish and hope. One must act—and act right” The Daily Stoic, p.136
- “’When the standards have been set, things are tested and weighed. And the work of philosophy is just this, to examine and uphold the standards, but the work of a true good person is in using those standards when they know them.’ -Epictetus, Discourses, 2.11.23-25 We go through life responding and reacting but it’s rare to really pause and ask: ‘Is this thing I’m about to do consistent with what I believe?’ Or better, ‘Is this the kind of thing the person I would like to be should do?’“ TDS p.302
- Actively choose something in every circumstance, because if you don’t, a choice will be made for you by default and it probably won’t be in your control, or something that you like.
- “Deliberation, thoughtfulness, and consciousness while traveling along a path means pausing between events or situations to consider and choose what to do, which way to go. If consciousness intervenes between stimulus and response, we can make conscious choices rather than following instinctive or programmed responses.” -The Tao of Psychology, p.90
- Try to never do anything on autopilot, especially in respect to your purpose in life, never execute on it on autopilot. The best way to live is to be present at every moment, and live in the now. Bringing awareness and mindfulness to the present will not only keep you grounded, it will keep you happy. You can bring awareness to your forward thinking self as well, being present in the now doesn’t preclude any sort of proactive, goal-oriented, or analytical living, it just brings a presence to it.
- Mindfulness is about present and purposeful living. It’s not wholly about sitting with eyes closed and body still, but about slowing the mind down to bring presence and purpose to every moment. You can be active and also be mindful. You can be ambitious and also be mindful. At a simple level it’s just about presence and purpose in life.
- I think mindfulness meditation, stoicism, and the other ideas I have in here aren’t only about just slowing down to a pace that might interfere with your relationships with others. It’s about having purpose to your pace. Most of the time that will mean slowing down the pace so you aren’t in a frenzy, but it will also allow you to purposefully act quickly when needed. Purposeful action is smooth. Purposeful action is deliberate, and therefore “slow”
- Anxious, abstract, conscientious people miss the moment by overthinking. Overly practical, never-analyzers miss the moment because they live by default. There is a middle ground.
- There may or may not be an afterlife, hopefully there is, but the point is we cannot know. This just means you should try to make your time count that you know you have. No afterlife should breed appreciation and gratitude for what you have, rather than lead to a paranoid and anxious existence
- Focus on what matters. “Which will help your children more — your insight into happiness and meaning, or that you followed breaking political news every day for thirty years?” The Daily Stoic, p.116
- “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.” - Gandalf, LOTR
- “If you’re like most people, you’ll spend most of your time in life tacitly presuming you’ll live forever. It’s like watching a bad movie for the fourth time, or bickering with your spouse, these things only make sense in light of eternity. There better be a heaven if I’m going to waste my time like this.” Sam Harris, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI3a5m-lFVg 19:25
- Live each moment as if it’s the last thing you’ll ever do.
- “Don’t forget to ask: ‘is this really the life I want?’ Every time you get upset, a little life leaves the body. Are these really the things on which you want to spend that priceless resource?” The Daily Stoic, p.52
- “We all sorely complain of the shortness of time, and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives are either spent in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to do. We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.” -Seneca
- “Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing.” Oscar Wilde, Dorian Gray
- “The person is free who lives as they wish, neither compelled, nor hindered, nor limited — whose choices aren’t hampered, whose desires succeed, and who don’t fall into what repels them” - Epictetus, Discourses, 4.1.1-3a (The Daily Stoic, p.74)
- If it’s not a hell yes, it’s a no.
- “One of the hardest things to do in life is to say ’No.’ To invitations, to requests, to obligations…Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement, distraction, obsession, lust. …Run amok, they become a commitment like anything else. Do you ever wonder how you can get some of your time back, how you can feel less busy? Start by learning the power of ‘No!’…“The more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do. This will let you live and enjoy your life — the life that you want.” - The Daily Stoic p.11
- “‘Every habit and capability is confirmed and grows in its corresponding actions, walking by walking, running by running…therefore, if you want to do something make a habit of it, if you don’t want to do that, don’t, but make a habit of something else instead.’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.1-5; Think about your activities of the last week as well as what you have planned for today and the week that follows. The person you’d like to be, or the person you see yourself as — how closely do your actions actually correspond to him or her? Which fire are you fueling? Which person are you becoming?” The Daily Stoic, p.147
- “Vivere est Militare (To live is to fight)” TDS p.179

### Have Fun
- “Nature has intermingled pleasure with necessary things – not in order that we should seek pleasure, but in order that the addition of pleasure may make the indispensable means of existence attractive to our eyes.” - Seneca, Moral Letters, 116.3
- “Play probably isn’t a word that you would immediately associate with training the mind, but it’s actually really important to have a lightness of touch, a sense of play. When life becomes too serious, the mind becomes very rigid and we very quickly fall out of balance. We’re very quickly overwhelmed. Everything feels sort of tight when things get very serious like that. As long as there’s a sense of play, of lightness - it doesn’t mean not taking things seriously, but it does mean not taking ourselves too seriously, not taking our thoughts too seriously - that really helps to create the conditions for balance in the mind and in our life.” - Headspace, Balance, Day 8 intro
- “‘We should take a lighter view of things and bear them with an easy spirit, for it is more human to laugh at life than to lament it’ -Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 15.2 The Stoics saw little purpose in getting angry or sad about things that are indifferent to our feelings…And at least humor is productive — makings things less heavy, not more so.” TDS p.256
- “In your actions, don’t procrastinate. In your conversations, don’t confuse. In your thoughts, don’t wander. In your soul, don’t be passive or aggressive. In your life, don’t be all about business.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.51 (TDS, p.209)
- “A healthy sense of humor is an invaluable friend on the meditative path. It allows us to be more open, honest, curious, and courageous. It also allows us to smile and let go. Or requires a certain willingness to laugh at oneself. We all have some crazy thoughts in our mind. It’s perfectly normal, natural. And we have the ability to apply a bit of humor to the extreme or random thoughts, to laugh as we let them go. If we can bring that sense of playfulness to life then it naturally becomes more enjoyable. ” - Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Sense of Humor”, Sunday Jan. 13, 2019
- “Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing.” Oscar Wilde, Dorian Gray
- “Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is exiled? Perhaps art is even a necessary correlative of, and supplement for, science?” - Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy
- Nietzsche’s Apollonian and Dionysian are both required
- Don’t deny the Dionysian - Connect with the universe - enjoy art - be wild - cut loose - enjoy sex - eat good food - cry - play - truly enjoy life
- “We need to develop individual practices that re-create a web of interconnection with the natural world that we have lost,” he says. “They must immerse the self so deeply in the wild that boundaries of self and Other dissolve.” -Jack Turner, in "Not Ours to Exploit," Terry Tempest Williams, THE PROGRESSIVE
- “What counts as wildness and wilderness is determined not by the absence of people, but by the relationship between people and place. A place is wild when its order is created according to its own principles of organization—when it is self-willed land." -Jack Turner, in "Not Ours to Exploit," Terry Tempest Williams, THE PROGRESSIVE
- “Positive emotions that connect you to things larger than yourself boost happiness: awe, gratitude, thanksgiving, wonder at the universe, seeing beauty outside yourself.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
- “’Leisure without study is death — a tomb for the living person’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 82.4 Make sure you enjoy your relaxation like a poet — not idly, but actively, observing the world around you, taking it all in, better understanding your place in the universe. Take a day off from work every now and then, but not a day off from learning…The purpose of retirement is not to live a life of indolence or to run out the clock, as easy as that might be….To sit around all day and do nothing? To watch endless amounts of television or simply travel from place to place so that you might cross locations off a checklist? That is not life. It’s not freedom either.” TDS p.288
- “It’s so common to hear surfers compliment each other on their carves, they really appreciate the beautiful, simple motion of gliding across water. In skiing, people become so focused on what happens in the air, they forget what we already have on the ground. We have an incredible vessel, a stunning white ocean in front of us. And that’s the side Chris can you show you. These sunny days in Canada are when I saw Chris at his best, meticulously planning his line at the top of every run, trying to emphasize the natural shapes of the mountain with his skiing. All I had to do was hang on for the ride. After spending two seasons with Chris, and learning the philosophy he brings to his skiing, it’s made me realize there is a limit to the number of flips someone can do off of a jump, but beauty and style are boundless. The athlete in Chris is what got him to the top, but the artist in Chris will keep him there.” - Chasing AdVANture with Chris Benchetler in 4k, GoPro YouTube video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNs68O5JSKg
- “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2
- Creative expression is a vital yin to the rational, scientific yang.
- Meditate
- “’We should take wandering outdoor walks, so that the mind might be nourished and refreshed by the open air and deep breathing.’ - Seneca, On Tranquility, 17.8 Today, make sure you take a walk. And in the future, when you get stressed or overwhelmed, take a walk. When you have a tough problem to solve or a decision to make, take a walk. When you want to be creative, take a walk. When you need to get some air, take a walk. When you have a phone call to make, take a walk. When you need some exercise, take a long walk. When you have a meeting or a friend over, take a walk. Nourish yourself and your mind and solve your problems along the way.” TDS, p.187
- “An essential support for this inner sense of balance is understanding change…the experience of it, not the idea of it, not thinking about change, but really understanding from an experiential point of view, what it means that everything is changing from moment to moment. There’s always a certain amount of uncertainty in our life. If we can be comfortable resting in this uncertainty, then we find a very pleasurable sense of balance. If we’re always fighting, trying to stay in control, hold on to things, then there’s always a lot of tension in the mind, and the more tension there is, the more rigid things are, and therefore the more easily they’re upset, the more easily we fall out of balance. Learning to be comfortable with the fact that everything is changing, everybody is always changing, even our own thoughts and emotions, seeing that directly can really help lead to a greater sense of balance in the mind.” Headspace, Balance, Day 7
- Zeek: “I know what it’s like though, you got a house full of kids, you got no money coming in, and you feel like you’re in the middle of things, and you’re being pushed and pulled in different directions.” Crosby: “Exactly” Zeek: “Well, you got to…you got to try to enjoy it, son, you know? Have a little fun, and scare the bear. It just goes by fast.” - Parenthood, S6E5, 35:00

### Cultivate an Internal Locus of Control
- “‘The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to with the choices I actually control.’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.5.4-5; The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t…time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not spent on the things we can change.” The Daily Stoic, p.9
- “There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of yourself.” - Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings
- “If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.47 (TDS p.336)
- “‘It isn’t events themselves that disturb people, but only their judgments about them’ - Epictetus, Enchiridon, 5; The samurai swordsman Musashi made a distinction between our ‘perceiving eye’ and our ‘observing eye.’ The observing eye sees what is. The perceiving eye sees what things supposedly mean. Which do you think causes the most anguish?” The Daily Stoic, p.112
- “By turning the mind inwards, by observing our resistance to challenging emotions, not only do we prevent the emotion from escalating, but we understand the true source of our suffering. So very often the internal struggle that we experience, of course it perhaps has its trigger in the world around us, maybe it’s something that a particular person said, maybe it’s something that’s happened to us in our environment. Instinctively, we want to look at that person, or at that thing, or the situation and blame that situation. But as long as we’re involved in that, we’re just really, one, fanning the flames of the emotion by thinking about it, but also we’re not really understanding where the source of that struggle has come from. And because of that we just continue to repeat this behavior over and over again in our life. But if we can, even just once, restrain ourselves from looking outwards and instead just pause and notice the feeing, whether it’s the emotion or the thinking that arises in that moment, if we can watch that, rather than blame, then we’ll see something happen. We’ll see a shift, we’ll see a chance, and all of a sudden, we start to see that it’s not always the thing itself which is the problem, but rather our reaction to that thing, our relationship to that thing. And as we continue down that route then we start to find a a sense of freedom and ease in the mind.” -Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “The source of suffering,” Friday, Dec. 14, 2018
- “Sometimes we take something very simple, very straightforward, and we create a world in which it consumes our every waking hour... it’s very often the smaller things, the things we’ll look back at and ask ourselves how we got so caught up in that? So very often it’s not the thing, it’s our relationship with that thing, the way that we attach ourselves to a certain idea, or experience, or person, or place, whatever it might be, and we create a world around that. We create a narrative around it, we create a story around it, and before we know it, we are lost in thought, just thinking about that thing...So just noticing when the mind attaches itself very tightly to a certain thing, when you find yourself consumed with thought, and in that moment just noting it as thinking, as feeling, letting it go and coming back to whatever you’re doing at the time.” -Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Complicating the Simple” Tues. Oct. 30, 2018
- “We might think that it’s our external environment that dictates our happiness, but it tends to be our relationship to our environment that ultimately defines our experience. So as we’re going about our everyday life it’s really tempting to think that whatever’s going on in the world around us is somehow defining or shaping our sense of happiness or unhappiness. But, of course, we can have days where everything is going great and for some reason we still don’t feel particularly happy inside. Likewise we might have days where it’s very difficult, circumstances are very challenging and yet nothing really seems to touch us that much. We seem to feel quite calm and content regardless. It’s really important to notice this, whether it’s in meditation or in everyday life, and to recognize that that sense of contentment comes from within.” -Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Defining our Experience”, Th., Sep. 20, 2018
- “For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who had failed to do so, his mind will remain his greatest enemy.” - the Bhagavad Gita
- “If a person gave away your body to some passerby, you’d be furious. Yet you hand over your mind to anyone who comes along, so they may abuse you, leaving it disturbed and troubled - have you no shame in that?” Epictetus, Enchiridion, 28 “Maintain control over your mind and perceptions…, It’s your most prized possession”The Daily Stoic, p.78
- “‘You have been formed of three parts - body, breath, and mind. Of these, the first two are yours insofar as they are only in your care. The third alone is truly yours’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 12.3 Up until the very end, our mind is ours. It’s not that the other two parts of life don’t matter. They’re just less ‘ours’ than our mind” The Daily Stoic p.125
- “There really is no such thing as an objectively good or bad occurrence…Situations require our participation, context, and categorization in order to be ‘bad’ [or good]” - The Daily Stoic, p.64
- “The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company...a church....a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude...I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you...we are in charge of our attitudes.”

- “Petty frustrating crap is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don’t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to I’m going to be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop.” Deliberately choose your outlook - This is Water, David Foster Wallace https://vimeo.com/107746121 - Mindfulness
- “If we’re always fighting, trying to stay in control, hold on to things, then there’s always a lot of tension in the mind, and the more tension there is, the more rigid things are, and therefore the more easily they’re upset” Headspace, Balance, Day 7
- Outlook and attitude aren’t just important, they dictate how you experience the world, and they are the only thing you have 100% control over, so choose to be happy first, choose to see the good, choose gratitude instead of guilt, appreciation instead of anxiety, happiness instead of discontentment.
- Circumstances don’t dictate your happiness, your attitude does.
- Since you bring meaning to circumstances and occurrences, be deliberate about what meaning you ascribe to them (see: Live Life on Purpose)
- If it’s possible to have extremely good circumstances, but still be the most wretched miserable person in the world, then it’s possible to be happy, hopeful, and positive in the worst possible circumstances. You dictate how you feel, not your circumstances or environment.
- “Be happy => Great Work => Big Success” The Happiness Equation, p.6
- Working hard and achieving success doesn’t lead to happiness. Being happy first leads to success.
- “If you really learned how to think, how to pay attention, then you will know that you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow consumer-hell-type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness that all things, not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that’s capital T true is that you get to decide how you’re gonna try and see it.” David Foster Wallace, This is Water, https://vimeo.com/107746121
- Focus on the positive - try to remember the lottery that you’ve already one: you’re alive (most people who’ve lived on earth aren’t), you get to experience life, you have more money than most people in the world, you get to cuddle your kids and your wife, etc.
- See your life from a measured, but more broad perspective: https://vimeo.com/55073825
- “Positive emotions that connect you to things larger than yourself boost happiness: awe, gratitude, thanksgiving, wonder at the universe, seeing beauty outside yourself.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
- “Happy people pay attention to the good in others and the things that are going right…interpret other people and events around them in a positive light, and see opportunities and possibilities. And they take time to remember and be grateful for the good things in their lives.“
- “Happy people are committed to making time for and enjoying friends and family. They have people they count on and trust.” https://continuum.utah.edu/features/what-happy-people-do/
- Negative emotions don’t usually lead to positive ones. Worrying about something won’t lead to peace of mind about it. Just be optimistic, content, thoughtful, confident, happy, calm, and meditative, assertive, etc. Life is worse when you choose negative emotions: anxiety, paranoia, sadness, or anger (“The wise person will endure that, but won’t choose it — choosing to be at peace, rather than at war” Seneca, Moral Letters, 28.7, The Daily Stoic, p.46)

- "Desire is not the problem. Clinging as a result of craving is. Thirst is not a desire or a craving. It is a sensation. Hunger is not a desire or a craving. It is a sensation. In any case, you are free to have desires and even pursue them. What will cause suffering is by clinging to the things you desire and crave, clinging to things that are not permanent as permanent, clinging to fantasies that do not accord with the way things are, clinging to the past even though it no longer exists, etc” (https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/559nfd/comment/d88qowc?st=ITQK2V7D&sh=0acbad15)
- "Ceaseless, ardent desire - if not bad in itself - is fraught with potential complications…when we pine for something, when we hope against hope, we set ourselves up for disappointment…That green light that Gatsby strove for can represent seemingly good things too, like love or a noble cause. But it can wreck someone all the same.” The Daily Stoic, p.61
- If a person wasn’t wanting something outside of their own control, why would they be stricken by anxiety?” Epictetus, Discourses, 2.13.1
- “I do not accept your anger and your criticism. It is all yours. … If you become angry with me and I do not get insulted, than the anger falls back on you. You are the only one who becomes unhappy, not me. All you have done is hurt yourself.” -Buddha
- Happiness is now. You choose to be happy now - “When we chase after happiness as a movement, it’s away from the present moment to another place, to some time other than now. And because we move away from the present moment, ironically, we move further away from happiness. Because when you think about it, happiness can only exist in this moment, right here, right now.” Chasing Happiness, Headspace video, https://my.headspace.com/play/79
- “‘It’s ruinous for the soul to be anxious about the future and miserable in advance of misery, engulfed by anxiety that the things it desires might remain its own until the very end. For such a soul will never one at rest — by longing for things to come it will lose the ability to enjoy present things’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 98.5b-6a Feeling bad in advance is totally voluntary…The pragmatist, the person of action, is too busy to waste time on such silliness….Let the news come when it does. Be too busy working to care.“  TDS p.250
- “It is quite impossible to unite happiness with a yearning for what we don’t have.’ Epictetus, Discourses, 3.24.17 Locate that yearning for more, better, someday and see it for what it is: the enemy of your contentment. Choose it or your happiness.” The Daily Stoic, p.57
- “Why bother getting mad at causes and forces far bigger than us?…After all, external events are not sentient beings - they cannot respond to our shouts and cries.” The Daily Stoic, p.63

- Find the right perspective to view the world from - sometimes its big, sometimes its small, sometimes in between. “Nell teaches aspects of parenthood never understood before.

- “Someone can’t frustrate you, work can’t overwhelm you,  these are external objects, and they have no access to your mind. Those emotions you feel, as real as they are, come from the inside, not the outside…We can’t blame other people for making us stressed or frustrated any more than we can blame them for our jealousy. The cause is within us.” The Daily Stoic, p.88
- “The more you familiarize the mind and body with appreciation, the more it arises in your life” - Headspace, “Appreciation” #7
- “The cause of irritation - or our notion that something is bad - that comes from us, from our labels or our expectations. Just as easily, we can change those labels; we can change our entitlement and decide to accept and love what’s happening around us.” The Daily Stoic, p. 89
- “People seek retreats for themselves in the country, by the sea, or in the mountains. You are very much in the habit of yearning for those same things. But this is entirely the trait of a base person, when you can, at any moment, find such a retreat in yourself. For nowhere can you find a more peaceful and less busy retreat than in your own soul - especially if on close inspection it is filled with ease.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.3.1; The Daily Stoic, p.91
- “We can find a retreat at any time by looking inward. We can sit with our eyes closed and feel our breath go in and out. We can turn on some music and tune out the world. We can turn off technology or shut off those rampant thoughts in our head. That will provide peace. Nothing else.” The Daily Stoic, p.91
- “There are two ways to be wealthy - to get everything you want, or to want everything you have. Which is easier right here and right now?” The Daily Stoic, p.95
- The law of attraction, or in motorcycle terms, target fixation, is what causes outlook to heavily influence outcome. When you fixate and focus on something, you subconsciously gravitate to that thing. Focus on the bad and you’ll live the bad. Focus on the good and you’ll live the good.
- “Your mind will take the shape of what you frequently hold in thought, for the human spirit is colored by such impressions” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.16; in The Daily Stoic, p.103
- Find a place of calm and strength inside yourself. Learn to love and have compassion for yourself like a very accepting, supportive parent would love you. Love yourself like Fred Rogers would love you. “When you’re capable of loving, accepting, and forgiving yourself no matter what, you’ll have the emotional energy to love, accept, and forgive others. When your cup is full of love to yourself, you could give more to others.” (https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/8api2x/fear_of_not_being_good_enough_episode_2_constant/?st=JFSBV4P2&sh=fc412057)

- “‘When you first rise in the morning tell yourself: I will encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.1 …The point of this preparation is not to write off everyone in advance. It is that, maybe, because you’ve prepared for it, you’ll be able to act with patience, forgiveness, and understanding” The Daily Stoic, p.108
- “From the very beginning, make it your practice to say to every impression ‘you are an impression and not at all what you appear to be.” Next, examine and test it by the rules you possess, the first and greatest of which is this - whether it belongs to the things in our control or not in our control, and if the latter, be prepared to respond, ‘It is nothing to me’” Epictetus, Enchiridon, 1.5; The Daily Stoic, p.111
- “All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry - all forms of fear - are caused by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence.” - Eckhart Tolle
- “Trust, but verify” especially your own senses, wants, desires, impressions, and feelings.

- “‘All the things which cause complaint or dread are like the taxes of life’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 96.2 Everything we do has a toll attached to it…Waiting around is a tax on traveling. Disagreements and occasional frustration are taxes placed on even the happiest of relationships…There are many forms of taxes in life. You can argue with them, you can go to great — but ultimately futile — lengths to evade them, or you can simply pay them and enjoy the fruits of what you get to keep” The Daily Stoic p.117

- “‘I’m constantly amazed by how easily we love ourselves above all others, yet we put more stock in the opinions of others than in our own estimation of self…How much credence we give to the opinions our peers have of us and how little to our very own!’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 12.4; Although we control our own opinions, we don’t control what other people think — about us least of all. for this reason, putting ourselves at the mercy of those opinions and trying to gain the approval of others are a dangerous endeavor.“ The Daily Stoic. p.160
- “And if you choose to hold fast to what is right, do not be irked by difficult circumstances, but reflect on how many things have already happened to you in life in ways that you did not wish, and yet they have turned out for the best.” — Gaius Musonius Rufus, Fragment 27
- “The key to happiness is low expectations. Lower. Nope, even lower. There you go.”

Fool, don’t you have hands?’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.16.13 Succumbing to the self-pity and ‘woe is me’ narrative accomplishes nothing - nothing except sapping you of the energy and motivations you need to do something about your problem.” TDS, p.171

- “If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging” - “Today, give yourself the most simple and doable of tasks: just don’t make stuff worse. Whatever happens, don’t add angry or negative emotions to the equation. Don’t react for the sake of reacting. Leave it as it is. Stop digging. Then plan your way out.” The Daily Stoic, p.177
- “‘That which is an impediment to action is turned to advance action. The obstacle on the path becomes the way.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.20 You have the power to use the Stoic exercise of turning obstacles upside down, which takes one negative circumstance and uses it as an opportunity to practice and unintended virtue or form of excellence…Every impediment can advance action in some form or another” TDS p.196 (p.231)
- “‘There is no vice which lacks a defense, none that at the outset its’t modest and easily intervened…For every emotion is at first weak. Later it rouses itself and gathers strength as it moves along - it’s easier to slow it down than to supplant it.’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 106.2b03a ’Rivers’ Publilius Syrus reminds us with and epigram, ‘are easiest to cross at their source.’ that’s what Seneca means too. The raging waters and early currents of bd habits, ill discipline, chaos, and dysfunction — somewhere they began as no more than just a trickle.” TDS p175
- “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” Viktor E. Frankl
- “How important it is to catch the mind, in a soft way, a very light way. When you realize the mind’s racing off, knowing that it’s quite possibly racing off to a place of imbalance, when you feel an emotion begin to get very strong, recognizing that if you can be present with that emotion, and it offers you the opportunity of choice, of not allowing it to overwhelm you, but instead simply being present with it, experiencing it, and then letting it go, maintaining that sense of balance. ” Headspace, Balance Day 9, epilogue, https://my.headspace.com/play/69
- “’The task of a philosopher: we should bring our will into harmony with whatever happens, so that nothing happens against our will and nothing that we wish for fails to happen.’ -Epictetus, Discourses, 2.14.7 This isn’t just semantic playing. It is a central facet of the philosopher’s worldview. Today, don’t try to impose your will on the world. Instead see yourself as fortunate to receive and respond to the will in the world.“ TDS p.200
- “’Receive without pride, let go without attachment.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.33 [Cato] responded to the honor [of being assigned command of the military] and the dishonor [having the command stripped days after assignment] the same way: with indifference and acceptance. Do not take the slights of the day personally — or the exciting rewards and recognitions either, especially when duty has assigned you an important cause. Trivial details like the rise and fall of your position has nothing to say about you as a person. Only your behavior — as Cato’s did — will.” TDS

- “’Whenever disturbing news is delivered to you, bear in mind that no news can ever gee relevant to your reasoned choice. Can anyone break news to you that your assumptions or desires are wrong? No.’ -Epictetus, Discourses, 3.18.1-2 The proper response of the Stoic to [bad] events is not to not care, but mindless meaningless sympathy does very little either (and comes at the cost of one’s own serenity, in most cases). If there is something you can actually do to help these suffering people, then, yes, the disturbing news (and your reaction to it) has relevance to your reasoned choice. If emoting is the end of your participation, then you ought to get back to your own individual duty.” TDS p.221
- “We’ve all chased things we thought would matter…What do we find when we actually attain these sacred objects? Not that they are empty or meaningless, but what we find is they are not enough…There is something better out there: real virtue. It is its own reward” TDS p.224
- “When people say that stoics are dour or depressive, they’re really missing the point. Who cares if someone is bubbly when times are good? what kind of accomplishment is that? But can you be fully content with your life, can you bravely face what life has in store from one day to the next, can you bounce back from every kind of adversity without losing a step, can you be a source of strength and inspiration to others around you? That’s Stoic joy - the joy that comes from purpose, excellence, and duty.” TDS p.227
- “’You must stop blaming God, and not blame any person. You must completely control your desire and shift your avoidance to what lies within your reasoned choice. You must no longer feel anger, resentment, envy, or regret’ -Epictetus, Discourses, 3.22.13 Don’t get emotional — get focused” TDS p.233
- “Apply yourself to thinking through difficulties — hard times can be softened, tight squeezes widened, and heavy loads made lighter for those who can apply the right pressure.” - Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 10.4b (TDS p.235)
- “When an emotion like anger appears, we might wish it were different. That’s like looking at an apple tree with red apples and wishing they were green. Wishing is not going to change the color of the apples. We have an in-built, or a learned, condition where we tend to resist those thoughts and emotions that we perceive as unpleasant, or that we dislike. As soon as we have that relationship with it, that it’s bad, it’s unpleasant, we don’t like it, we wish it didn’t exist, then we’ve created a relationship with it, and it’s a relationship of dislike, perhaps even distrust. So there’s a tension, there’s a conflict in the mind whenever that emotion appears. The challenge is that, as human beings, we are regularly going to experience those emotions, so we’re setting ourselves up for a difficult mindset. If, instead, we can have a slightly more open mindset, one where, when anger, or anxiety or sadness arises in the mind, instead, if we can be interested in it; more sort of curious in it, stepping back from the thinking about it. Instead, simply witnessing the sensation, then we lose that sense of this is good, this is bad. We start to see everything from the viewpoint of awareness.” -Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “The Wishing Habit” Th. Sep. 25, 2018
- Action eases the mind, takes time and energy away from anxiety, depression.
- “If you deem as your own only what is yours, and what belongs to others as truly not yours, then no one will ever be able to coerce or to stop you, you will find no one to blame or accuse, you will do nothing against your will, you will have no enemy, no one will harm you, because no harm can affect you.” -Epictetus, Enchiridion, 1.3
- “Our power over our own mind and our power to make our own decisions can’t be broken - only relinquished.” - TDS p.268
- “To witness a thinking mind is a humbling experience. It’s not always beautiful, not always as we’d like it to be. But it’s enough to be humbled, we don’t need to add guilt to it too. So when we first sit to meditate we might be quite shocked at how many thoughts there are in the mind. We might be quite shocked at the types of thoughts there are in the mind. We might be surprised at how judgmental, how critical the mind is sometimes. And very often this can lead to a feeling of guilt. It’s as though we have an idea of what we would like the mind to be like, what we think it should be like, and then how the mind appears as we witness it. But as long as we’re getting involved in the thinking as it arises, we’re simply creating another layer of thinking. We’re creating more storylines in the mind, more noise in the mind. So as much as possible, seeing that when it happens, letting it go, knowing that, within the framework of meditation, thinking is just thinking. It doesn’t matter what type of thinking it is. We don’t need to feel a certain way about it, or think a certain way about it. But inevitably, we will feel humbled by the mind.
- “Often life is less complicated than it appears. Sometimes we take something very simple, very straightforward, and we create a world in which it consumes our every waking hour. Of course there are things that happen in life, things that we experience, mental phenomena that we might experience, that are genuinely challenging. They’re the big challenges in life, and they, of course, deserve our full attention. But at other times, it’s very often the smaller things, the things we’ll look back at and ask ourselves how we got so caught up in that? So very often it’s not the thing, it’s our relationship with that thing, the way that we attach ourselves to a certain idea, or experience, or person, or place, whatever it might be, and we create a world around that. We create a narrative around it, we create a story around it, and before we know it, we are lost in thought, just thinking about that thing. Tt might go on for a few hours, it might go on for a few days, a few weeks even. But at some stage, we let go of it. And we almost can’t believe that we got so caught up in it. So just noticing when the mind attaches itself very tightly to a certain thing, when you find yourself consumed with thought, and in that moment just noting it as thinking, as feeling, letting it go and coming back to whatever you’re doing at the time.” -Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Complicating the Simple” Tues.

- “You know what's wrong with you, Miss Whoever-you-are? You're chicken, you've got no guts. You're afraid to stick out your chin and say, ‘Okay, life's a fact, people do fall in love, people do belong to each other, because that's the only chance anybody's got for real happiness.’ You call yourself a free spirit, a "wild thing," and you're terrified somebody's gonna stick you in a cage. Well baby, you're already in that cage. You built it yourself. And it's not bounded in the west by Tulip, Texas, or in the east by Somali-land. It's wherever you go. Because no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.” -Paul Varjack, Breakfast at Tiffany’s
- “‘Not even safe circumstances will bring you confidence once your mind has been shocked — once it gets in the habit of blind panic, it can’t provide for it’s own safety’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 104.10b If your mind has developed a certain cast — the habit of panicking in Seneca’s example {or anger, or hate, or lust, or sadness} — then it won’t matter how good things get for you. You’re still primed for panic. Your mind will still find things to worry about, and you’ll still be miserable…This is why it’s foolish to hope for good fortune. If you were to hope for one thing, you could hope for the strength of character that’s able to thrive in good {or bad} fortune. Or better, work for that kind of character and confidence.” TDS p.289
- “’Try praying differently, and see what happens: Instead of asking for “a way to sleep with her,” try asking for “a way to stop desiring to sleep with her.” Instead of “a way to get rid of him,” try asking for “a way to not crave his demise.” Instead of “a way to not lose my child,” try asking for “a way to lose my fear of it.”’ Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.40.(6) What about asking for fortitude and strength so you can do what you need to do? What if you sought clarity on what you do control, what is already within your power? you might find your prayers have already been answered.” TDS p276
- “’What if someone despises me? Let them see to it. But I will see to it that I won’t be found doing or saying anything contemptible. What if someone hates me? Let them see to that. But I will see to it that I’m kind and good natured to all, and prepared to show even the hater where they went wrong.’ -Marcus Aurelius Meditations, 11.13 The Stoic does two things when encountering hatred or i’ll opinion of others. They ask ‘Is this opinion inside my control?’ If there is a chance for influence or change, they take it. But if there isn’t, they accept this person as they are (and never hate the hater). Our job is tough enough already. We don’t have time to think about what other people are thinking, even if it’s about us” TDS p.279
- “See through the thoughts that arise in the mind but, at the same time, befriend them, accept them and come to a place of ease.” - Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Befriending Thoughts” Tuesday, Dec 4
- “When forced, as it seems, by circumstances into utter confusion, get ahold of yourself quickly. Don’t be locked out of the rhythm any longer than necessary. You’ll be able to keep the beat if you are constantly returning to it.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.11 TDS p.283 — This is knows as Noting in the mindfulness meditation world. Stop. Note the chaos (emotion or thought). Return to the rhythm of your breath.

- “Whatever you resist, persists.”
- “There’s a very persistent idea in the mind, that life should be as we want it to be, rather than as it is. Because of this, we suffer. Accepting life as it is, we let go of this resistance. The temptation is to go straight to the idea that if i accept things then how can I make changes and become a better person in my life? But that’s not really what this is saying. Of course there are some things within our control in life that make sense to address, and by addressing them we create the conditions in which we can move forward in the direction we’d like to. But very often in life there are lots of things that we tend to resist, that we wish were different, that really we have no control over at all. And all of that mental, and sometimes physical tension, that’s spent resisting those things just creates exhaustion in the body and the mind. If we’re able, over time, to realize when we’re doing that, when we’re resisting something in life, that simply is as it is, that we’re unable to change, acknowledge it, and let go of it, then we start to find a greater sense of ease. We can use that additional energy toward those things we can actually change, and to point our life in a particular direction.” - Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Acceptance vs resistance” Tue. Jan. 8, 2019
- “We May live with the idea that we should always be happy, but this is not the nature of life. In accepting this simple truth, we discover a greater sense of ease in more challenging times. In many ways this is the heart of so much of our stress, our struggle, our discontent in life, to have this idea that life should always be happy. It’s a really strong idea, and there’s a lot of desire behind that idea, but we never really pause to think, is that even possible? Is that even appropriate, is that what we would want in our life? Reactively, we would assume that, yes, of course, we would, but when we’re going through a difficult time, if somebody close to us is unwell, do we necessarily want to be happy during that time? IF we lose someone close to us, would we want to be happy? The truth is the range of human emotion supports us throughout the journey, and throughout the many different circumstances that arise. We’re not always in a position in a situation where happiness, in terms of the happiness that we think of as not feeling sad, is not necessarily appropriate. We can perhaps talk about a contentment, or a sense of ease, that that exists beyond or beneath, that everyday happiness, that is with us in those times of happiness, but it’s also with us in those times of sadness. It’s a mind which is at ease with thinking, at ease with feelings, at ease with the world around us, no matter how it appears in that moment. It doesn’t mean that we necessarily want it to be that way, but at the same time, we’re not resisting it, and in not resisting it, we find a sense of contentment. So rather than striving for that everyday kind of happiness, and looking outward for that, looking inward and finding that sense of contentment, no matter how the mind or life appears in any given moment.”-Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Challenging times,” Monday January 14, 2019
- “What if, instead {of judging others behavior}, we ask about the times we have been false to our friends? Ultimately that’s what Stoicism is about — not judging other people’s behavior, but judging our own.” TDS p.311
- “Today we could hope that goodness comes our way — good news, good weather, good luck. Or we could find it ourselves, in ourselves.” TDS p.317
- “’Don’t trust in your reputation, money, or position, but in the strength that is yours — namely, your judgments about the things that you control and don’t control. For this alone is what makes us free and unfettered.’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 3.26,34-35 It just means focusing on and acquiring power rather than outward. As Publilius Syrus, himself a former slave, put it: ‘Would you have a great empire? Rule over yourself!’“ TDS p.332
- “‘If we judge as good and evil only the things in the power of our own choice, then there is not room left for blaming gods or being hostile to others.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.41 We don’t control things outside {our reasoned choice}, but we do control our attitudes and our responses to those events — and that’s plenty. It’s enough that we go into each and every day knowing that there is no one to pass the buck to. It ends with us. The Daily Stoic p.337
- “Not only do even the most fortunate of us complain, it often seems like the more fortunate we are, the more time we have to do so…Where does that thinking get you? Nowhere, other than in a negative state of mind…It’s so easy to complain about this or that, or to try to make excuses and justifications fo the things you’ve done. But that doesn’t accomplish anything — and it never lightens the load.” TDS p.338
- “‘He was sent to prison. But the observation “he has suffered evil,” is an addition coming from you.’ -Epictetus, Disocurses, 3.8.5b-6a An event itself is objective. How we describe it…is on us.“ TDS p.339
- “’When philosophy is wielded with arrogance and stubbornly, it is the cause for the ruin of many. Let philosophy scrape off your own faults, rather than be a way to rail against the faults of others.’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 103.4b-5a The proper direction of philosophy is focused inward. To make ourselves better and to leave other people to that task for themselves and their own journey…Leave other people to their faults. Nothing in Stoic philosophy empowers you to judge them — only to accept them.” TDS p.342

### Live in the Present Moment
- “The longest and shortest life, then, amount to the same, for the present moment lasts the same for all and is all anyone possesses.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.14; The Daily Stoic, p.85
- “When we chase after happiness as a movement, it’s away from the present moment to another place, to some time other than now. And because we move away from the present moment, ironically, we move further away from happiness. Because when you think about it, happiness can only exist in this moment, right here, right now.” Chasing Happiness, Headsapce video, https://my.headspace.com/play/79
- “‘Let us therefore set out whole-heartedly, leaving aside our many distractions and exert ourselves in this single purpose, before we realize too late the swift and unstoppable flight of time and are left behind. As each day arises, welcome it as the very best day of all, and make it your own possession. We must seize what flees.’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 108.27b-28a What will you manage to make of today before it slips from your fingers and becomes the past? When someone asks you what you did yesterday, do you really want the answer to be ‘nothing?’” The Daily Stoic p.143
- “Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.” Bil Keane in The Daily Stoic, p.85
- Don’t nostalgia for finite things from the past. Just be sure to soak up the finite things of now. limited isn’t sad unless you’re constantly wishing for more or longing for it to come back or last longer. Limited is great when you are present with it. Like each wave is finite in existence but wishing for other ones will make you miss the now ones. Also nostalgia is only good as far as it causes you to be more present now. Beyond that it’s pain.
- “This present is in our possession - but it has an expiration date, a quickly approaching one. If you enjoy all of it, it will be enough. It can last a whole lifetime.” The Daily Stoic, p.85
- “Leave the past behind, let the grand design take care of the future, and instead only rightly guide the present to reverence and justice” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 12.1 (TDS p.303)
- Basically, what is any moment currently asking from you? What is required of your attention, reason, or emotion at any given moment and do it.
- “Revamp your bucket list. Live in the moment. Put down your phone. Notice the people around you.”
- “No act is more valuable than the next when training the mind: meditation, walking, eating. All are opportunities to be present and at ease” Headspace app
- “‘The richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewal.’ …{The Power of Full Engagement}….” The Happiness Equation, p.22
- “All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry - all forms of fear - are caused by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence.” - Eckhart Tolle
- “There are two ways to be wealthy - to get everything you want, or to want everything you have. Which is easier right here and right now?” The Daily Stoic, p.95
- “We’re so busy watching out for what’s just ahead of us that we don’t take time to enjoy where we are” - Calvin and Hobbes
- “Happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future" -Seneca
- “Attention matters - letting your attention slip and wander builds bad habits and enables mistakes”  - The Daily Stoic, p.123
- “None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death. The capital T Truth is about life before death.” - David Foster Wallace, This is Water
- “Like bluebonnets in the spring, We're only here for a little while. It's beautiful and bittersweet, So make the most of every mile” - “Bluebonnets in the Spring” Aaron Watson
- “You get what you deserve. Instead of being a good person today, you choose instead to become one tomorrow.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.22; The Daily Stoic, p.156
- “‘I don’t complain about the lack of time…what little I have will go far enough. Today — this day — will achieve what no tomorrow will fail to speak about. I will lay siege to the gods and shake up the world.’ Today, not tomorrow, is the day that we can start to be good.” -Seneca, Medea, 423-425 (The Daily Stoic, p.156)
- “Infinitely swift is the flight of time, as those see more clearly who are looking backwards. For when we are intent on the present, we do not notice it, so gentle is the passage of time's precipitous flight” - Seneca, Moral Letters, 49.2 (The Daily Stoic, p.157)
- “As {Seneca} says, by pouring ourselves fully and intentionally into the present, it ‘gentle[s] the passing of time’s precipitous flight.’” TDS p.157
- Pause to look around before it’s behind you -hiking adage
- “I have realized that the past and future are real illusions, that they exist in the present, which is what there is and all there is.” - Alan Watts
- “We are living in a culture entirely hypnotized by the illusion of time, in which the so-called present moment is felt as nothing but an infinitesimal hairline between an all-powerfully causative past and an absorbingly important future. We have no present. Our consciousness is almost completely preoccupied with memory and expectation. We do not realize that there never was, is, nor will be any other experience than present experience. We are therefore out of touch with reality. We confuse the world as talked about, described, and measured with the world which actually is.” - Alan Watts
- “We tell ourselves that we need the right setup before we finally buckle down and get serious. or we tell ourselves that some vacation or time alone will be good for a relationship or ailment. This is self-deceit at its finest. It’s far better that we become pragmatic and adaptable — able to do what we need to do anywhere, anytime. The place to do your work, to live the good life, is _here_.” -TDS p.232
- “‘Don’t await the perfection of Plato’s Republic, but be satisfied with even the smallest step forward and regard the outcome as a small thing’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.29.(4) The idea is not to settle or compromise your standards, but rather not to become trapped by idealism…Do what you can now” TDS p.237
- “The greatest loss in life is to be so caught up in our own thoughts, so overwhelmed by our own feelings, that we miss the opportunity to connect with those around us. This is something we’ve all experienced from time to time. You’re going to want to be there for the people around us, especially for the people we really care about, and the people we spend a lot of time with, and yet so often, although we might be with them physically, our mind is elsewhere, caught up in everyday thinking, todo lists, anxieties, conversations that we had before, hoping things are going to turn out a certain way in the future. And in being absent in our mind, we are never truly present for that other person. So as much as possible, when you are with others, especially when you are with those that you care about, noticing when the mind is wandering off, noting it, letting it go, and coming back, not to the breath, but coming back to the other person. Maybe it’s something they’re saying, something they’re sharing, or maybe its simply coming back to being present in that space with the other person. The more often we do this, the easier it is to hear  what others have to say, the easier it is to share an experience with another person, and the easier it is to connect with the world around us.” -Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Missing out on life”, Tuesday, Sep 18, 2018
- “‘It’s ruinous for the soul to be anxious about the future and miserable in advance of misery, engulfed by anxiety that the things it desires might remain its own until the very end. For such a soul will never one at rest — by longing for things to come it will lose the ability to enjoy present things’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 98.5b-6a Feeling bad in advance is totally voluntary…The pragmatist, the person of action, is too busy to waste time on such silliness….Let the news come when it does. Be too busy working to care.“  TDS p.250
- Money is only exchanged, time is spent.
- Zeek: “I know what it’s like though, you got a house full of kids, you got no money coming in, and you feel like you’re in the middle of things, and you’re being pushed and pulled in different directions.” Crosby: “Exactly” Zeek: “Well, you got to…you got to try to enjoy it, son, you know? Have a little fun, and scare the bear. It just goes by fast.” - Parenthood, S6E5, 35:00
- “When forced, as it seems, by circumstances into utter confusion, get ahold of yourself quickly. Don’t be locked out of the rhythm any longer than necessary.

- “Nothing, to my way of thinking, is better proof of a well-ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.” Seneca
- “No one gets to enjoy their own legacy — by definition...Instead of wasting even a second considering the opinions of future people, focus every bit of yourself on being the best person you can be in the present moment…Be good and noble and impressive now — while it still matters.” TDS p. 314
- “’Hecato says “‘cease to hope and you will cease to fear.” …The primary cause of both these ills is that instead of adapting ourselves to present circumstances we send out thoughts too far ahead.’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 5.7b-8 Hope is generally regarded as good. Fear is generally regarded as bad. To a Stoic like Hecato…they are the same — both are projections in the future about things we do not control. Both are the enemy of this present moment that you are actually in. Both mean you’re living a life in opposition to amor fati...both contain a dangerous amount of want and worry. And, sadly, the want is what causes the worry.” TDS p.314
- “Revamp your bucket list. Live in the moment. Put down your phone. Notice the people around you.” — Be mindful of technology, it can take you out of the present moment easily
    - Technology takes you away from being present in the moment. Every moment you spend needlessly perusing your phone while your life happens around you, is a moment you miss, you don’t get to be part of, and one you don’t get back. I went through the car wash with 3-yr-old Nate. I have a vague memory of him bouncing excitedly back and forth in the car watching the scrubber and water go back and forth, but I was dialed into something unimportant on my phone, wasting time, and I missed that moment. I missed taking in his laughs, and laughing and engaging with him about something he was way into. And that’s the real problem, when you don’t engage with the people around you on stuff they see as important, you miss connecting with them and being there with them. You miss building memories. You’re not emphasizing experience in your life when you’re glued to your phone.
    - Completely unplug regularly. It’s good for your mental health. It’ll keep you present
    - Technology is there to serve you, not for you to be addicted to and escape and waste time. Learn how to be measured in your integration of technology in you life.
    - Technology addiction can distract you from living on purpose. Use it wisely and mindfully.
    - “Do you remember when only doctors had pagers?…Then suddenly everyone had pagers. Then everyone had cell phones. Now everyone is accessible, any way, any time…You need to remove access. Close the doors, lock the windows, answer the [one] bell [you’ve decided you’ll respond to]” The Happiness Equation, p. 198
    - “We can find a retreat at any time by looking inward. We can sit with our eyes closed and feel our breath go in and out. We can turn on some music and tune out the world. We can turn off technology or shut off those rampant thoughts in our head. That will provide peace. Nothing else.” The Daily Stoic, p.91
    - “‘The richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewal.’ …{The Power of Full Engagement}… A Kansas State University study found that complete downtime after work helps us recharge for the next day. Turning your phone off after dinner. Not using the internet on vacation.” The Happiness Equation, p.22
    - “With so much technology around us it’s really easy to forget we get to define our relationship with technology. We need to learn how to be a little less reactive and a little more responsive to every sound or vibration our phone makes” Headspace, Mindful Tech, Intro

### Settle Down - Relax
- Amor Fati
- “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2

- “‘Don’t seek for everything to happen as you wish it would, but rather wish that everything happens as it actually will - then your life will flow well.’ -Epictetus, Enchiridion, 8 Something happened that we wish had not. Which of these is easiest to change: our opinion of the even that is past? The answer is obvious. Accept what happened and change your wish that it had not happened. Soicism calls this the ‘art of quiescence’ … take it step further Instead of simply accepting what happens, they urge us to actually enjoy what has happened…’amor fati’ It’s not just accepting , it’s loving everything that happens. To which for what has happened to happen is a clever way to avoid disappointment because nothing is contrary to your desires. But to actually feel gratitude for what happens? to love it? That’s a recipe for happiness and joy.“ TDS p.326
- Since you don’t control everything, just learn to want what happens for those parts you don’t control. And if you can want it and love it and feel grateful for it, you’ll be happier for it.
- “You don’t have to believe there is a god directing the universe, you just need to stop believing that you’re that director. As soon as you can attune your spirit to that idea, the easier and happier your life will be, because you will have given up the most potent addiction of all: control.”TDS p.330
- “’The task of a philosopher: we should bring our will into harmony with whatever happens, so that nothing happens against our will and nothing that we wish for fails to happen.’ -Epictetus, Discourses, 2.14.7 This isn’t just semantic playing. It is a central facet of the philosopher’s worldview. Today, don’t try to impose your will on the world. Instead see yourself as fortunate to receive and respond to the will in the world.“ TDS p.200

- “The tools and aims of our training are unaffected by the turbulence of the moment. Stop. Regain your composure. It’s waiting for you.” The Daily Stoic, p.68
- “Whatever you resist, persists.”
- Anxiety is just you wanting to control that which is outside your control. Stress is modern-day smoking. Unconditionally relax.
- Things are fine. You’re ok. You’re not perfect. Learn to let things go. Holding on to negative emotions ruins your life.
- Give yourself an unconditional break. Forgive yourself. Trust yourself. Trust your loved ones. Have compassion for yourself.
- Don’t take everything so seriously. It’s good to be good, but nobody’s perfect. Cut everything and everyone some slack and don’t expect perfection anywhere, especially from yourself or your family or circumstances. https://reddit.app.link/1O3LUJUxrN You may think you’re just “optimizing” but you may find that you just end up being critical and judgmental of everything, and that people see you that way.
- “Don’t hang on to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.”
- “Having low self worth, not being compassionate toward yourself can cause trouble elsewhere in your life. If we have an attitude of low self worth and are constantly telling ourselves we’re the worst in the world, “we are at the same time cultivating a mind that is quite critical and judgmental and which inevitably spills over. So as we let go of this negative chatter towards ourself, we are at the same time freeing ourselves up from any judgment, criticism about others.” - headspace, self-esteem 24/30
- Reflect on your many blessings, not your few failures.
- Realize that there will always be downsides, imperfections, mistakes, harm, etc. Ride the waves, find your own inner peace. (mediation) (“there is no effort without error and shortcoming“)
- “A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it” - Jean de La Fontaine
- Be patient with yourself, and extend that to those around you.
- It’s impossible to live a perfect life; to not make mistakes and do (or not do) things you may regret later. Do what you can, but don’t sweat stuff too much. Live life as best as you can, but accept you won’t do everything perfectly, and let it go.

Over-happiness and excitement can be just as detrimental as as over-sadness or anger. You should seek to have the same aversion to over-happiness as you do to over-sadness, because they’re both mental agitation. Seek to be even-keeled, but don’t be afraid of emotion, it’s natural. Just be deliberate and mindful of the state when emotions are high.

- “’Hecato says “‘cease to hope and you will cease to fear.” …The primary cause of both these ills is that instead of adapting ourselves to present circumstances we send out thoughts too far ahead.’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 5.7b-8 Hope is generally regarded as good. Fear is generally regarded as bad. To a Stoic like Hecato…they are the same — both are projections in the future about things we do not control. Both are the enemy of this present moment that you are actually in. Both mean you’re living a life in opposition to amor fati...both contain a dangerous amount of want and worry. And, sadly, the want is what causes the worry.” TDS p.314
- “There are times when we might feel happy with ourselves. Other times, when we might feel sad. But in seeing that both can exist, we realize that neither can be true. Knowing this is freedom. What we’re talking about here is what lies beneath happiness, what lies beneath sadness…Things happen that won’t necessarily make us feel happy. But is there something beneath the happiness? And if there is, does that set us free? Because if it’s there when we’re happy, then it’s also there when we’re sad. Rather than investing heavily into that happiness, trying to hold onto it, rather than resisting or struggling with the sadness, instead, we’re able to rest, knowing that there is a deep sense of peace, contentment, whatever you want to call it, that exists beyond pure emotion. Emotions come and go, but there’s something else, a little bit deeper. And if we listen, we can begin to familiarize ourself with that sense of inner peace and calm.” -Headspace, Every day Headspace, “Emotions Come and Go”, Monday, Feb 4, 2019

- “We react to anger with anger. Fear with fear. Sadness with sadness. In doing so, we fan the flames, and keep the emotion alive. In truth, there’s no need to react. It’s enough to simply observe. Very often, when we experience a particular emotion, or mood, we tend to not only attach blame to a particular person or situation or even to ourselves, we tend to see our entire experience of the world through that lens. And of course we don’t like feeling that way, so if we experience some anger then we might feel angry about the fact that we feel angry. Or if we experience anxiety, it might make us feel anxious that that we’re experiencing anxiety. The mind is very clever in this way, it keeps itself busy. It keeps the emotion alive. It’s entertaining for the mind, even if it’s not a very comfortable experience. So it’s only really when we can step out of that cycle, when we can be present with the emotion as it is, whatever it is. Simply allowing it to pass us by.” Headspace, Stepping out of the Cycle, Wednesday, Sep. 5 2018

- “Go for meditativeness, not mediation, because meditation is a confined, limited activity. Meditativeness is a way of life.” -Acharya Prashant
- “I think at first it can be tempting to wonder what practicing meditation in a very particular environment got to do with feeling more patient in very difficult environments. If you think about it, when we’re sitting to train the mind in this way, we’re practicing patience. This is a practice of patience. When we’re sitting focusing on the breath and the mind is continually bringing up these thoughts and we keep getting distracted. That is the practice of patience. And so meditation provides us with the perfect environment, where we can do it in our own space and our own terms, we may not always like what arises in the mind, but at least we have a framework where we can see those thoughts arising clearly, where we can recognize any sense of impatience, and let it go, and come back to the breath. So it’s a trainmen that we can then take back out into the world. But it’s really important that we approach any sense of impatience in the mind with a very soft and patient mind, otherwise, we’re just getting impatient about feeling impatient, and that’s surprisingly easy to do. It’s an easy trap to fall into. Whether we’re noting, or however we’re approaching these thoughts in our mind, it’s really imprortant that we don’t apply too much judgement on them, instead, we just see them for what they are in that moment. It’s just thinking. We let it go, and we come back to the breath again.” -Headspace, Patience, Day 3
- “Patience is another word for peace of mind. If we think about the qualities of patience, it’s soft, it’s flexible, it’s malleable, it’s not fixed. Part of the challenge that many of us live with is that we think that there are certain ways that we should be, or must be. So we apply this idea of patience almost like a rule, like it’s something we should do. So there’s this conflict between what we’re actually experiencing and feeling in the moment, and what our mind is thinking, intellectually, rationally, logically that we should be like. So there’s that conflict between the two. As we start to recognize those thoughts arising in the mind, the shoulds, the coulds, the musts, we start to let go of that. In letting go of it, we create space, room to experience what is actually happing in that moment. And maybe in that moment it is impatience, and that’s absolutely fine. In allowing that to come to the surface, we’re creating the room for patience to exist. So we can let go of all those thoughts and ideals of what we should be, or must be, and find the space for this softer, kindler, gentler, more flexible kind of mind.” -Headspace, Patience, Day 4
- Meditation in 4 parts: “Relax and look for the joy. Observe. Let it come, let it be, let it go.” Relax: remove physical and mental tension. Joy: notice the pleasant aspects of the practice, even in the midst of the unpleasant. Observe: be aware without reaction or judgment. Let it: don’t suppress or struggle against thoughts. -based on https://imgur.com/CPImoIf which, i believe, is from The Mind Illuminated
- “‘We should take a lighter view of things and bear them with an easy spirit, for it is more human to laugh at life than to lament it’ -Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 15.2 The Stoics saw little purpose in getting angry or sad about things that are indifferent to our feelings…And at least humor is productive — makings things less heavy, not more so.” TDS p.256
- Stress is the gap between our expectations and reality. The bigger the gap the bigger the stress. Expect nothing, accept everything.
- “So long as we’re talking, there’s no room to listen. So long as the mind is busy, there’s no room for quiet. So be still once in a while, for both you and for those around you. It doesn’t matter if this is our internal world or our external world, when we sit to meditate we’re not actively trying to add more thoughts to our inner dialogue, we’re witnessing the mind, letting go of those thoughts, providing, creating a space in which we can listen to the mind. In the same way outwardly, when we’re with another person, if we can choose to listen, then we create a space in which that person feels understood, in which they feel heard. And as a result, not only to we have a greater peace of mind ourselves, but we tend to experience much happier relationships in our life.” -Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Stillness,” Tues.

It’s about attuning to the universe and discarding the toxic idea that we’re at the center of it…You don’t have to believe there is a god directing the universe, you just need to stop believing that you’re that director. As soon as you can attune your spirit to that idea, the easier and happier your life will be, because you will have given up the most potent addiction of all: control.”TDS p.330

For substance is like a river’s unending flow, it’s activities continually changing and causes infinitely shifting so that almost nothing at all stands still.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.23 ‘No man steps in the same river twice.’ Because the river has changed, and so has the man.

### Slow Down
- Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
- “Slow your breath down, just take it slow” - Future of Forestry, Slow your Breath Down
- Slowing down probably isn’t necessarily about moving at a snail’s pace at all times, it’s probably more about moving deliberately and purposefully. I think usually that will mean a slower, smooth, steady pace to your life, but won’t prevent you from acting quickly when necessary, being punctual, etc.
- Slow down. Hear people, listen to them fully before speaking. Don’t speak unless your sure it will bring value. “I begin to speak only when I’m certain what i’ll say isn’t better left unsaid.” Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 4
- Respond, don’t react. Don’t immediately react to anything. Internalize it, then think about how best to respond.
- “It’s the thinking mind alone that  wants to become bigger, to become better, or something special in the world. The other part, our essence, our awareness, has no such desire or ambition… Awareness is voiceless. It simply witnesses. It observes. It has no goal. It has no desire  to change anything, to be something more, to be something better. It simply witnesses life as it unfolds. As much as we need the thinking mind, the mind that plans and strives, at the same time that mind is typically quite busy. it’s trying to change, it’s trying to reach for something bigger and better and of course there are times in our life when that’s entirely appropriate and even necessary. But so often, when we think about ourselves in this way, that’s just not particularly helpful. Rather than being happy with ourselves as we are or content with ourselves as we are, we’re so busy trying to be somebody different, that we can’t even experience that sense of contentment in this moment right now. So learning to rest in awareness, we rely less on that thinking mind, the thinking mind that’s always reaching for something else, and instead we start to appreciate the value of resting right here in this moment right now.” Headspace, “Everyday Headspace,” Tuesday, June 19, Awareness and Ambition
- Patience. Sometimes stuff just needs time, no action, just time.
- “’Fortune doesn’t have the long reach we suppose, she can only lay siege to those who hold her tight. So, let’s step back from her as much as possible’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 82.5b-6 the metaphor here would be the choice between a strategy of endless, exhausting offense and a strategy of resilient, flexible defense. Which will you play?” TDS p.183
- “’Here is the great soul — the one who surrenders to Fate. The opposite is the weak and degenerate one, who struggles with and has a poor regard for the order of the world, and seeks to correct the faults of the gods rather than their own.’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, p.107.12 Let’s not wish we could turn back time or remake the universe according to our preference. Not when it would be far better and far easier to remake ourselves.” TDS p.184
- “To the youngster talking nonsense Zeno said, ‘The reason why we have to ears and only one mouth is so we might listen more and talk less.’” - Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, 7.1.23; TDS p.180
- “It’s really tempting to meditate for balance only when you’re feeling stressed or out of balance in some way. Often we just look to fix things when they already happen. But we should try and use the balance visualization {light above the head flowing into your body} on a regular basis, to really get comfortable with it to remind yourself of what it feels like to be grounded to have a sense of balance. The more time you spend in that place, the less likely you are to be overwhelmed. It’s no longer about putting out fires the whole time, instead it’s about preventing the fires from getting out of control in the first place. having the presence of mind to see thoughts and emotions beginning to run away and at the moment to say ‘I’m not going to do that this time. I’m just going to come back to that feeling of being present, of being balanced in both body and mind…Be aware throughout the day, find the moments in the day that you can remind yourself of this feeling of balance. In reminding yourself, all you’re doing is tapping back in to that innate quality of balance that’s always there. You’re reminding the mind what it’s like to rest in that space. The more you can do that, the more natural that tendency becomes, the more often you go to that place, the more time you spend in that place, and the greater the sense of balance there is in life” - Headspace, Balance, Day 3

- “’Silence is a lesson learned from the many sufferings of life’ -Seneca Thyestes, 309 ‘The more you say,’ Robert Greene has written, ‘the more likely you are to say something foolish.’ To that we add: the more you say the more likely you are to blow past opportunities, ignore feedback, and cause yourself suffering. The inexperienced and fearful talk to reassure themselves. The ability to listen, to deliberately keep out of a conversation and subsist without its validity is rare. Silence is a way to build strength and self-sufficiency.” TDS p.234
- Better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool, than open it and remove all doubt.
- “A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness.” -Albert Einstein
- “When forced, as it seems, by circumstances into utter confusion, get ahold of yourself quickly. Don’t be locked out of the rhythm any longer than necessary. You’ll be able to keep the beat if you are constantly returning to it.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.11 TDS p.283 — This is knows as Noting in the mindfulness meditation world. Stop. Note the chaos (emotion or thought). Return to the rhythm of your breath.
- “We might think that silence is passive, not useful to resolution and debate, but it’s the very foundation, a place of calm and clarity, from where we can hear what others have to say. There are two parts to this. The first part is out ability to be present for what others have to say. When we’re very caught up in our own thinking, we’re particularly attached to an idea, opinion, or belief, then it’s really hard to be present, curious, interested, to have a willingness to hear what another person wants to share. But if we’re able to put those things down, then we can really be present for that moment. And in doing so, we also add the element of space. So rather that someone saying something that doesn’t sit well with us, and then us just reacting to that. Instead, in that moment of space, There is the opportunity to consider, and then respond. And it’s though  path of skillful response rather than knee-jerk reaction, that we get to a resolution. Where we can actually have constructive conversation. Rather than thinking of stillness as passive, it can actually be a really important ingredient to any difficult conversation.” — Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Active Stillness,” Saturday, December 29, 2018
- “‘This is the very thing which makes up the virtue of the happy person and a well-flowing life — when the affairs of life are in every way tuned to the harmony between the individual divine spirit and the will of the director of the universe.’ - Chrysippus, Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 7,1,88 {It} really has less to do with ‘god’ than…the letting go.

- “The more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do. This will let you live and enjoy your life — the life that you want.” - The Daily Stoic p.11
- “I have long sense thought that the mentality we encounter a lot "you only live once" is really empty. You try desperately to do as much as you can while racing the proverbial hourglass and it turns into this race to nowhere. It seems sad because in a way the more you deceive yourself into thinking you could ever live enough life seems to make life go by faster and faster. I prefer to accept the finite nature, embrace that we are witnessing a glimpse of existence, and then every moment seems more meaningful. I don't need to be constantly doing something new and exciting to enjoy my life. Its always an uphill battle to keep life simple, to find time to watch a sunset or look at the stars or just become present in the moment. And then there's those people who actively rush through life, chasing every new adventure, not realizing that they are running in place. TL:DR I guess what I am trying to say is human life it too short to make it about quantity but we can certainly make it about quality. https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/93d0xh/comment/e3cvurp?st=JKARA06V&sh=f7e3420a

- Find the very few things that are the absolute most important and focus most of your energy on them. Minimalism isn’t about getting rid of things, it’s about elevating a few very important things to the forefront of your life. It’s about not having to panic clean for visitors. It’s about having more money for the things you truly enjoy because you’re not buying everything in sight. It’s about valuing the few things you have. It’s about valuing people and experiences over things. It’s about simplifying your life, reducing complexity and complication. https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/8qv2sm/minimalism_for_me_is/?st=JIDXYDM4&sh=45904b51

    * Watching my sons throw a baseball
    * Listening to my grandparents tell stories
    * My girlfriend surprising me with a kiss on the cheek
    * Holding my wife in my arms knowing there's no where in the world I'd rather be
    * Gram's Sunday dinners and the whole family getting together
    * My dog
    * Seeing my fiancé smile and feeling his arms wrap around me
    * My daughter running to me when I get home
    * The smell of flowers and rain
    * The day I got married. I said I never would. And then I met her. And now I have to leave her.
    * Smelling the fireplace on Christmas morning with the family
    * All my friends
    * Watching my family sleep
    * The rush of weekday mornings. I know it sounds crazy, but I'll miss it. I'll miss the coffee, the crowded bathrooms, my wife's quick peck goodbye, the kids forgetting their lunch.. you get my point
    * Rain. Is that weird?
....notice none of these things cost any money. They don't include technology. They're not grand gestures.

Put down your phone. Notice the people around you.

To the Stoics, there is: by changing what it is that you want…Today, you could try to increase your wealth, or you could take a shortcut and just want less.” TDS p.258
- “‘Let us get used to dining out without the crowds, to being a slave to fewer slaves, to getting clothes only for their real purpose, and to living in more modest quarters’ -Seneca, On Tranquility, 9.3b One way to protect yourself from the swings of fate is by living within your means now. So today, we can try to get used to having and surviving on less so that if we are ever forced to have less, it would not be so bad” TDS p.273

### Love Yourself and Others
- “Love for one’s self and love for one another are one in the same thing. We often lean more towards one than the other, but in learning meditation, we discover there’s enough room for them both. So as we sit to meditate, we very quickly realize that either we find it very easy to feel a sense of love and kindness to ourself, or we find it very difficult. In just the same way, we very quickly discover that it’s either very easy to send a feeling of love and kindness to somebody else, or it’s very difficult. Neither is right nor wrong. It’s simply the way that the mind has been conditioned or the way that we have lived our experience of life. But whether we lean more towards one or the other, meditation has a way of balancing it out. We might want to rush that experience, but, of course, we just have to wait for the process to unfold. But in time we see that, really, there is no separation. Whether it’s love internally, or love externally. Ultimately they’re one in the same thing.” -Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “One love” Wednesday, Sep 19, 2018
- “The greatest gift we can offer another person is to allow them to be who they are, and not what we want them to be. The same can be said with our relationship to self.” -Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “The Greatest Gift,” Sunday, November 11, 2018
- Love and Empathy for Self
    - Loving yourself is the starting place to everything else. It helps you develop a sense of who you are, and who you want to be. This is where you start from when you find and develop your purpose, once you have that you can begin to live on purpose, enjoy the moment, develop your character, etc. it all starts with loving your true self.
    - Healthy love starts with self-love, or self-compassion, and then goes out to another person in the form of intimacy and attachment. It ends with altruism.
    - “Be softer with you. You are a breathing thing. A memory to someone. A home to a life.” - Nayyirah Waheed
    - “You rarely have time for everything you want in this life, so you need to make choices. And hopefully your choices come from a deep sense of who you are” - Fred Rogers
    - “You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection.” - Buddha
    - “Settling into your true, weird, authentic self isn’t easy, but it’s the most satisfying way to have everything” The Happiness Equation, p 243
    - Self awareness leads to self-discovery. Self-discovery leads to self-familiarity, which leads to self-satisfaction, self-love, and self-care.
    - “’Philosophy calls for simple living, but not for penance — it’s quite possible to be simple without being crude’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 5.5 Marcus’ meditations are filled with self-criticism and so are the writings of other Stoics. It’s important to remember, however that that’s as far as it goes. There was no self-flagellation, no paying penance, no self-esteem issues from guilt or self-loathing…their self-criticism is constructive….Hold yourself to a higher standard, but not an impossible one. And forgive yourself if and when you slip up” TDS p.194
    - Find a place of calm and strength inside yourself. Learn to love and have compassion for yourself like a very accepting, supportive parent would love you. Love yourself like Fred Rogers would love you. “When you’re capable of loving, accepting, and forgiving yourself no matter what, you’ll have the emotional energy to love, accept, and forgive others. When your cup is full of love to yourself, you could give more to others.” (https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/8api2x/fear_of_not_being_good_enough_episode_2_constant/?st=JFSBV4P2&sh=fc412057)
    - “As we build up the exercise, so we’ll shift our attention away from ourselves, and more towards others. But the starting place is with ourselves. If we don’t have a sense of calm, a sense of kindness, or forgiveness toward ourself, then it’s going to be really difficult to have that towards others. So the two things aren’t really so different, it’s like they’re two sides of the same coin. If we develop one, at the same time we’re developing the other.” - Headspace, Relationships, Session 3
    - “Self-care is not selfish. You cannot serve from an empty vessel.” - Eleanor Brownn
    - “Be you and be cool with it…There is nothing more satisfying than being loved for who you are and nothing more painful than being loved for who you’re not, but pretending to be.” The Happiness Equation, p.238
    - “Confidence is a funny thing. People sometimes assume it’s about repeating a story in the mind, over and over again. One that makes us look or feel really good. But the problem is, when we have an artificial confidence like this, it’s always tinged with fear. What happens if it lets us down? What happens if we lose the storyline? What happens if doubt creeps in? But there’s a kind of confidence, you could call it quiet confidence, that’s almost the opposite. It means letting go of all that stuff. Putting down the storylines. And when we let go of it, we experience something else. We experience vulnerability, uncertainty, and openness. But within that, somewhere we discover quiet confidence.  Perhaps it’s just a byproduct to being willing to exist without those comforting stories. But the incredible thing is, because it’s not separate from ourselves, we can’t lose it. it’s indestructible, and that’s the beauty of it. To rest with that sense of vulnerability, not necessarily knowing, but at the same time, being confident in not knowing. That’s quiet confidence.” - Headspace animation, Confidence
    - “Confidence isn’t ‘They will like me.’ Confidence is ‘I’ll be fine if they don’t.’”
    - “Think thyself fit and worthy to speak, or to do anything that is according to nature, and let not the reproach, or the report of some that may ensue upon it, ever deter thee” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
    - “I can’t afford to hate people. I don’t have that kind of time.“ -Bob Ross (Applicable first to yourself)
    - “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” - MLK
    - “Hate is too great a burden to bear” -MLK
    - “‘Don’t be ashamed of needing help. You have a duty to fulfill just like a soldier on the wall of battle. So what if you are injured and can’t climb up without another soldier’s help?’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.7 No one ever said you were born with all the tools you’d need to solve every problem you’d face in life…You can ask anyone for help. You don’t have to face everything on your own.” TDS p.182
    - “He said, ‘You become. It takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are Real you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.’”
    - “Meditation helps us let go. Not only of the expectations that we place on ourselves, but also of those placed upon us by others. There’s a palpable relief in letting go of it all. So whether it’s real or imagined, I think very often in life we have a sense that there are certain expectations placed upon us. It doesn’t matter whether they’re real or imagined, the feeling is the same. And those feelings tend to weigh us down. It means we’re always trying to meet the standards or meet the ideas of other people, rather than having the freedom and the space of mind to be ourselves, to be comfortable with being ourselves. Whether that idea is coming from outside or they are our own expectations, if we can find a way of putting those down, instead being comfortable, at ease with ourselves as we are, then we start to find a happier, more contented mind.” -Headspace, Everyday Headspace, “Expectations,” Wednesday Oct 10, 2018
    - “Someone told me the other day that he felt bad for single people because they are lonely all the time i told him that's not true l'm single and i don't feel lonely i take myself out to eat i buy myself clothes i have great times by myself once you know how to take care of yourself company becomes an option and not a necessity” - Keanu Reeves
    - “How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself and in no instance bypass the discriminations of reason? You have been given the principles that you ought to endorse, and you have endorsed them. What kind of teacher, then, are you still waiting for in order to refer your self-improvement to him? You are no longer a boy, but a full-grown man. If you are careless and lazy now and keep putting things off and always deferring the day after which you will attend to yourself, you will not notice that you are making no progress, but you will live and die as someone quite ordinary. From now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer, and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event” -Epictetus
    - “Take care of yourself like you were someone you cared for” -Jordan Peterson
    - “Nothing, to my way of thinking, is better proof of a well-ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.” Seneca
    - “Men seek retreats for themselves - in the country, by the sea, in the hills - and you yourself are particularly prone to this yearning. But all this is quite unphilosophic, when it is open to you, at any time you want, to retreat into yourself. No retreat offers someone more quiet and relaxation than that into his own mind, especially if he can dip into thoughts there which put him at immediate and complete ease: and by ease I simply mean a well-ordered life. So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself. The doctrines you will visit there should be few and fundamental, sufficient at one meeting to wash away all your pain and send you back free of resentment at what you must rejoin. And what is it you will resent? Human wickedness? Recall the conclusion that rational creatures are born for each other's sake, that tolerance is a part of justice, that wrongdoing is not deliberate. Consider the number of people who spent their lives in enmity, suspicion, hatred, outright war, and were then laid out for burial or reduced to ashes. Stop, then. Or will you fret at your allocation from the Whole? Revisit the alternatives -providence or atoms - and the many indications that the universe is a kind of community. But will matters of the flesh still have their hold on you? Consider that the mind, once it has abstracted itself and come to know its own defining power, has no contact with the movement of the bodily spirit, be that smooth or troubled: and finally remember all that you have heard and agreed about pain and pleasure. Well then, will a little fame distract you? Look at the speed of universal oblivion, the gulf of immeasurable time both before and after, the vacuity of applause, the indiscriminate fickleness of your apparent supporters, the tiny room in which all this is confined. The whole earth is a mere point in space: what a minute cranny within this is your own habitation, and how many and what sort will sing your praises here! Finally, then, remember this retreat into your own little territory within yourself. Above all, no agonies, no tensions. Be your own master, and look at things as a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. And here are two of the most immediately useful thoughts you will dip into. First that things cannot touch the mind: they are external and inert; anxieties can only come from your internal judgement. Second, that all these things you see will change almost as you look at them, and then will be no more. Constantly bring to mind all that you yourself have already seen changed. The universe is change: life is judgement. " - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4

    - I genuinely think people need each other, not all in the same way, but we need people in our life who unconditionally love us and whom we love, however that’s actually expressed. It could be a spouse, a friend, a sibling, or maybe even a pet. I think humans need love and attachment in their life. Loving and being loved is an essential need. I chose a wife and kids, but that’s not a required path.

We must be there for each other. We must take care of each other (and allow others to care for us in return). To pretend otherwise is to violate our nature, to be more or less than what it means to be a human being.” TDS p.321

    - On healthy relationships, romantic loves should naturally shift more toward attachment. Make sure you and your partner are worthy of each other’s full, trusting attachment.
    - “To love another person is to see the face of God” - Les Miserables
    - “The lesson I have learned is when someone you love is doing something that hurts you. Don't try and control them by making them stop. Rather have the courage to break up with them when they continue to do the thing you told them hurts you. If they wont stop, they don't love you and you should move on.”
    - “It’s impossible to love someone and control them at the same time” - Terry Crews.
    - Love is pure, unbiased appreciation of and compassion for another, and therefore comes without expectation of how the other should behave or be. To love someone is to let them be, without putting on them your expectation for what they might be or reciprocate. Therefore, you cannot control someone and love them at the same time. If they love you, they will reciprocate your love and appreciation for who you are, without putting on you the expectation of behavior, being, or reciprocation. This is why love and trust, especially in a committed romantic relationship, are so intertwined, and why love without trust is a rotten thing. This is unconditional love.
    - It’s not your job to keep the people you love happy. You individually be happy and bring that to the relationship.
    - “You cannot make a person happy. You can make a person smile, you can make a person feel good, you can make a person laugh, but whether or not a person is happy is deeply and totally and utterly out of your control…I said to Jada ’That’s it. I retire from trying to make you happy. I need you to go make yourself happy….’ And after we cracked the hell up we realized we had come into this false romantic concept that somehow when we got married that we would become one. And what we realized is that we were two completely separate people on two completely separate individual journeys and that we were choosing to walk our separate journeys together, but her happiness was her responsibility and my happiness was my responsibility. And we decided that we were gonna find our individual, internal private separate joy, and then we were gonna present ourselves to the relationship and two each other already happy, not coming to each other begging, with our empty cups out _demanding_ that she fill my cup and she meet my needs. It’s unfair and its kind of unrealistic and can be destructive to place the responsibility for your happiness on anybody other than yourself.” - Will Smith, Instagram Video,
    - The more you assert yourself the more someone knows how to fulfill your needs. The more quiet you are in your relationship the less idea they have about how to take care of you. People don’t read minds. Speak your needs. Speak your wants.

    - ”For me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete (and correct) his own personality in that of another (and finally in children and even grandchildren) and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides. And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover; no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. In the end, they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself…After all, almost the main work of life is to come out of our selves, out of the little dark prison we are all born in. Masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process. The danger is that of coming to love the prison." -C.S. Lewis

    - “Whenever someone has done wrong by you, immediately consider what notion of good or evil they had in doing it. For when you see that, you’ll feel compassion, instead of astonishment or rage.” Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.26; The Daily Stoic, p. 82
    - “Nobody thinks they’re wrong, even when they are. They thing they’re right, they’re just mistaken…Could it be that the slights you’ve experienced or the harm that others have done to you was not inflicted intentionally? What if they they simply thought they were doing the right thing - for them, even for you?…How much more tolerant and understanding would you be today if you could see the actions of other people as attempts to do the right thing?” The Daily Stoic, p.82
    - “‘When you first rise in the morning tell yourself: I will encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.1 …The point of this preparation is not to write off everyone in advance.

    - “Relationships don't work the way they do on television and in the movies. Will they? Won't they? And then they finally do, and they're happy forever. Gimme a break. Nine out of ten of them end because they weren't right for each other to begin with, and half of the ones who get married get divorced anyway, and I'm telling you right now, through all this stuff, I have not become a cynic, I haven't. Yes, I do happen to believe that love is mainly about pushing chocolate covered candies and, y'know, in some cultures, a chicken. You can call me a sucker, I don't care, because I do believe in it. Bottom line is: it's couples who are truly right for each other wade through the same crap as everybody else, but the big difference is they don't let it take them down. One of those two people will stand up and fight for that relationship every time. If it's right, and they're real lucky, one of them will say something.” - Dr. Cox, Scrubs, S1
    - “Whenever you kiss your child, or sibling, or friend, don’t layer on top of the experience all the things you might wish, but hold them back and stop them…Remind yourself that your precious one isn’t one of your possessions, but something given for now, not forever…” - Epictetus, Discourses, 3.24.84-86a (TDS p.349)

For what can even the most malicious person do if you keep showing kindness and, if given the chance, you gently point out where they went wrong — right as they are trying to harm you?’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5.9a …The expected reaction to hatred is more hatred…Most rudeness, meanness, and cruelty are a mask for deep-seated weakness. Kindness in these situations is only possible for people of great strength. You have great strength. Use it.” The Daily Stoic p.146
- “’Every event has two handles, one by which it may be carried, the other by which it cannot.

In fact, all they actually want us to do is hear them.” TDS p.191
- “Or course it’s possible to curb our arrogance, control our anger, and be a caring person. How do you think others do it?…They worked on it. They made it a priority. They solved it like they would solve any other problem: by dedicating themselves to finding a solution, making incremental progress until they did.” TDS p195
- “The Stoics believed that every person, animal, and thing has a purpose or a place in nature. Even in ancient Greek and Roman times, they vaguely understood that the world was composed of millions of tiny atoms. It was this idea — this sense of an interconnected cosmos — that underpinned their sense that every person and every action was part of a larger system. Everyone had a job — a specific duty…The most critical part of this system was the belief that you, the student who has sought out Stoicism, have the most important job: to be good. To be wise…Do your job today. Whatever happens, whatever other people’s jobs happen to be, do yours. Be good.” TDS p198
- “The goodness inside you is like a small flame, and you are its keeper…Everyone has their own version of the flame and is responsible for it, just as you are.

- “Everyone wants to be happy, even those who hurt us. Realizing this does not negate their actions, but it helps us create the conditions for understanding and forgiveness. We all do things in our live that hurt others, even though we want happiness for ourselves. Seeing this provides the room to understand that other person. Ultimately, to forgive.” Headspace, Understand and Forgive Th. Sep. 6, 2018

They will never be able to keep you from doing what’s sound, so don’t let them knock out your goodwill for them…For getting angry is also a weakness.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.9 Just as you must not abandon your new path simply because other people may have a problem with it, you just not abandon those other folks either. Don’t simply write them off or leave them in the dust. Don’t get mad or fight with them. After all, they’re at the same place you were not long ago.” TDS p.214
- “As Plato said, every soul is deprived of truth against its will….It’s essential to constantly keep this in your mind, for it will make you more gentle to all.” Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 7.63 (TDS p.216)
- “‘When you first rise in the morning tell yourself: I will encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.1 …The point of this preparation is not to write off everyone in advance. It is that, maybe, because you’ve prepared for it, you’ll be able to act with patience, forgiveness, and understanding” The Daily Stoic, p.108
- “Nobody thinks they’re wrong, even when they are. They thing they’re right, they’re just mistaken…Could it be that the slights you’ve experienced or the harm that others have done to you was not inflicted intentionally? What if they they simply thought they were doing the right thing - for them, even for you?…How much more tolerant and understanding would you be today if you could see the actions of other people as attempts to do the right thing?” The Daily Stoic, p.82
- “Whenever someone has done wrong by you, immediately consider what notion of good or evil they had in doing it. For when you see that, you’ll feel compassion, instead of astonishment or rage.” Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.26; The Daily Stoic, p. 82
- “‘The unjust person acts against the gods. For insofar as the nature of the universe made rational creatures for the sake of each other…anyone breaking nature’s will obviously acts against the oldest of gods’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.1.1 We say of the most heinous acts that they are crimes against nature …our sense of justice goes marrow deep….The key, then, is to support our natural inclination to justice with strong boundaries and strong commitments — to embrace, as Lincoln urged a divided, angry nation to do, ‘the better angels of our nature.’” TDS p.217
- “You don’t have to do the right thing, just as you don’t have to do your duty. You get to. You want to.” TDS p.219
- “‘Whenever you take offense at someone’s wrongdoing, immediately turn to your own similar feelings…by thinking on this, you’ll quickly forget your anger.’” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 10.30 Earlier we were reminded of Socrates’s tolerant belief that ‘no one does wrong on purpose.’ The clearest proof of that hypothesis? All the times we did wrong without malice or intention….Be as forgiving of [others] as you are of yourself. Cut them the same slack you would for yourself.” TDS p.260
- Be good to yourself, be good to others, be good to animals, be good to the planet.
- “A good Stoic understands that proper impulses, and the right actions that arise from them, naturally carry the good of the whole, which is the wise person’s only good.” TDS p.297
- “Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.” - Marcus Aurelius
- True moral wrong is when you do real harm to yourself or another person (and doing wrong to another person, does wrong to self). It has nothing directly to do with any given moral code or sin, like don’t watch porn or don’t lie or don’t have premarital sex, etc. Only inasmuch as those things do harm should they be avoided. Beyond that, do whatever doesn’t harm yourself or someone else.
- “‘The person who does wrong, does wrong to themselves. The unjust person is unjust to themselves — making themselves evil’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.4 “Self-awareness and wrongdoing rarely go together. If you need a selfish reason to not do wrong — put yourself in touch with {how you feel about yourself after you’ve done wrong}. They’re a powerful disincentive.” TDS p.300
- “You can always get up after you fall, but remember, what has been said can never be unsaid. Especially cruel and hurtful things.” TDS p.298
- “‘Yes, getting your wish would have been so nice. But isn’t that exactly why pleasure trips us up? Instead, see if these things might be even nicer — a great soul, freedom, honesty, kindness, saintliness. For there is nothing so pleasing as wisdom itself, when you consider how sure-footed and effortless the works of understanding and knowledge are.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.9 Pleasures hardly stand up to virtue. The dopamine that comes from {pleasures} is momentary…What lasts longer (and remains more within our circle of control)? Wisdom, good character, sobriety, and kindness.” TDS p. 301
- “’When the standards have been set, things are tested and weighed. And the work of philosophy is just this, to examine and uphold the standards, but the work of a true good person is in using those standards when they know them.’ -Epictetus, Discourses, 2.11.23-25 We go through life responding and reacting but it’s rare to really pause and ask: ‘Is this thing I’m about to do consistent with what I believe?’ Or better, ‘Is this the kind of thing the person I would like to be should do?’ {Every moment is an opportunity to live your standards} Not —I want to do good— that’s an excuse. But, ‘I will do good in this particular instance, right now.’ Set a standard. Hold fast to it.“ TDS p.302
- “‘How rotten and fraudulent when people say they intend to ‘give it to you straight.’ What are you up to, dear friend? It shouldn’t need your announcement, but readily be seen, as if written on your forehead, heard in the ring of your voice, a flash in your eyes — just as the beloved sees it all int he lover’s glance. In short, the straightforward and good person should be like a smelly goat — you know when they are in the room with you.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.15 If you have too preface your remarks with indications of honesty or directness, what does that say about everything else you say? If you say you’re being honest now, does that mean you usually aren’t? What if, instead, you cultivated a life and reputation in which honesty was as bankable as a note from the Treasury, as emphatic and explicit as a contract, as permanent as a tattoo?” TDS p.304
- “‘The best way to avenge yourself is to not be like that.’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.6 ‘How much better to heal that to seek revenge from injury. Vengence wastes a lot of time and exposes you to many more injuries than the first that sparked it. Anger always outlasts hurt. Best to take the opposite course.’ - Seneca, On Anger, 3.27.2 If someone treats you rudely and you respond with rudeness, you have not done anything but prove to them that they were justified in their actions…It’s awful to be a cheat, to be selfish, to feel the need to inflict pain on our fellow human beings. Meanwhile, living morally and well is quite nice.” TDS, p.306
- “A virtuous person is generous with assumptions: that something was an accident, that someone didn’t know, that it won’t happen again. This makes life easier to bear and makes us more tolerant. Meanwhile, assuming malice — the most hasty of judgements — makes everything harder.” TDS p.308
- “today we could hope that goodness comes our way — good news, good weather, good luck. Or we could find it ourselves, in ourselves.” TDS p.317
- “‘The human being is born with an inclination toward virtue’ - Musonius Rufus, Lectures, 2.7.1-2 We’re made to help each other and be good to each other. We wouldn’t have survived as a species otherwise…You were born with an attraction to virtue and self-mastery. If you’ve gotten far from that, it’s not out of some inborn corruption but from a nurturing of the wrong things and the wrong ideas. As Seneca has pointed out, philosophy is a tool to strip it all away and get back to our true nature.” TDS p.324

### Find a Metaphysical Meaning
- “Meditate often on the interconnectedness and mutual interdependence of all things in the universe. For in a sense, all things are mutually woven together and therefore have an affinity for each other — for one thing follows after another according to their tension of movement, their sympathetic stirrings, and the unity of all substance.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.38 (TDS p.296)
-  “Anne Lamott once observed that all writers ‘are little rivers running into one lake,’ all contributing to the same big project. The same is true in many industries — though sadly, even inside the same company, people selfishly forget they’re working together. As human beings we all breathe the atoms that made up our ancestors and flow into the same earth when we die…{We must not forget} how we’re related to our fellow human beings and the environment.” TDS p.296
- “Inherent in the Stoic concept of sympatheia is the notion of an interconnected cosmos in which everything in the universe is part of a larger whole” TDS p.297
- ”A good Stoic understands that proper impulses, and the right actions that arise from them, naturally carry the good of the whole, which is the wise person’s only good.” TDS p.297
- “There is a beautiful dialogue called ‘Icaromenippis, and Aerial Expedition’ by the poet Lucian in which the narrator is given the ability to fly and sees the world from above. He sees how comically small even the richest people the biggest estates, and entire empires look from above. All their battles and concerns were made petty in perspective…Edgar Mitchell, an astronaut, was one of the first people to see the earth from outer space. As he later recounted: ‘In outer space you develop and instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty.’ Many a problem can be solved with the perspective of Plato’s view. Use it.” TDS p.168
- “’There is no good for a human being except what creates justice, self-control, courage, and freedom, and nothing evil except what destroys these things.’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 8.1.(5) TDS p. 313
- “‘This is the very thing which makes up the virtue of the happy person and a well-flowing life — when the affairs of life are in every way tuned to the harmony between the individual divine spirit and the will of the director of the universe.’ - Chrysippus, Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 7,1,88 {It} really has less to do with ‘god’ than…the letting go. It’s about attuning to the universe and discarding the toxic idea that we’re at the center of it…You don’t have to believe there is a god directing the universe, you just need to stop believing that you’re that director. As soon as you can attune your spirit to that idea, the easier and happier your life will be, because you will have given up the most potent addiction of all: control.”TDS p.330
- _Wandrers Nachtsong 1_
    ```
    Der du von dem Himmel bist,
    Alles Leid und Schmerzen stillest,
    Den, der doppelt elend ist,
    Doppelt mit Erquickung füllest;
    Ach, ich bin des Treibens müde!
    Was soll all der Schmerz und Lust?
    Süßer Friede,
    Komm, ach komm in meine Brust!
    ```

### Assert Yourself and Protect Your Boundaries
- “When we do not express ourselves, do not assert our being, do not stand up for our values in contexts where it is appropriate to do so, we inflict wounds on our sense of self. The world does not do it to us - we do it to ourselves.” The Six Pillars of Self-esteem, p 124
- Be good, but take no shit
- Love all, trust few, do harm to none.
- Be nice but don’t let people take advantage of or manipulate you (see: live life on purpose). This will help you avoid manipulation and being taken advantage of, but will still provide you the chance to be compassionate to people without sacrificing compassion for yourself.
- Everyone deserves your unconditional kindness and generosity. As long as they respect and reciprocate that, it will flow freely. Once they abuse that, they have to earn it back. (They had their chance they blew it)
- You teach people how to treat you by what you tolerate. Being assertive keeps people from taking advantage of your niceness. If you only ever be nice, you’ll be an enabler, especially to your loved ones. Being assertive, asking for what you want, checking your close people, will lead to a place where you both get more of what you want and neither of you is allowed to let the worst parts of yourself grow (doubt, insecurity, anxiety, jealousy). It’s the Facebook effect. FB only ever served up the stuff you clicked on, which is usually the shit that gets you the most riled up in anger or disgust. Being too nice panders to every personality trait a person has, that's ok when you don't see the person a lot, but for close relationships that can bring out the bad parts of people as well as the good. You create codependency.
- “Be you and be cool with it…There is nothing more satisfying than being loved for who you are and nothing more painful than being loved for who you’re not, but pretending to be.” The Happiness Equation, p.238
- Healthy boundaries and self-assertion are the foundation of good relationships (along with empathy and understanding).
- “Those who matter don’t mind. And those who mind don’t matter” -Bernard Baruch
- “It’s a moral obligation to pursue what you find meaningful. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. It might require sacrifice  ….First, imagine you were taking care of yourself like you were someone you cared for. Then, if you could have what you needed and wanted, what would it be? What sort of friends would you have? What would your family relationships look like? How would you conduct yourself with your children? How would you educate yourself? You need to think through how it is that your life could be properly arranged if you had that ability. And then you can aim at that. If you do posit a goal of that sort, and work toward it, you will move towards it. The goal will change, because you’ll learn things along the way…Things inevitably get better for people {following this pattern}. It’s not a luxury, its difficult, it’s a moral responsibility. It isn’t happiness, the pursuit isn’t for happiness, it’s to pursue what is meaningful. ” -Jordan Peterson
- Good people will behave properly with your trust. Those people belong in your life. Bad people will behave poorly with your trust. Kick them out.
- Be assertive about your wants, needs, and boundaries. On expressing yourself with your loved ones: I want your consent, I’d like your participation, I need neither. It’s not their job to make you happy and express your wants and needs for you. You have to do it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E
- If you don’t speak your truth it’s like you’re suffocating yourself.
- The first thing to do when trying to walk the line between being nice and being assertive is to know who you are. When you have a firm grasp on who you are and what you want, you can then assert that.
- “You can lie down for people to walk on you and they will complain that you are still not flat enough. Live your life.”
- “Think thyself fit and worthy to speak, or to do anything that is according to nature, and let not the reproach, or the report of some that may ensue upon it, ever deter thee” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
- “Confidence isn’t ‘They will like me.’ Confidence is ‘I’ll be fine if they don’t.’”
- Doubt is the opposite of confidence. They cannot exist together. One has to yield to the other.
- “I do not accept your anger and your criticism. It is all yours. … If you become angry with me and I do not get insulted, than the anger falls back on you. You are the only one who becomes unhappy, not me. All you have done is hurt yourself.” -Buddha
- “It’s impossible to love someone and control them at the same time” -Terry Crews
- “The lesson I have learned is when someone you love is doing something that hurts you. Don't try and control them by making them stop. Rather have the courage to break up with them when they continue to do the thing you told them hurts you. If they wont stop, they don't love you and you should move on.”
- “Of course I deprecate war, but if it is brought to my door the bringer will find me at home” - James Garfield, in The Daily Stoic, p.90
- “Trust, but verify”
- “‘When your sparring partner scratches or head-butts you, you don’t then take a show of it, or protest, or view him with suspicion or as plotting against you. And yet you keep an eye on him, not as an enemy or with suspicion, but with a healthy avoidance. You should act this way with all things in life. We should give a pass to many things with our fellow trainees.’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.20; The Daily Stoic 128
- “‘How rotten and fraudulent when people say they intend to ‘give it to you straight.’ What are you up to, dear friend? It shouldn’t need your announcement, but readily be seen, as if written on your forehead, heard in the ring of your voice, a flash in your eyes — just as the beloved sees it all int he lover’s glance. In short, the straightforward and good person should be like a smelly goat — you know when they are in the room with you.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.15 If you have too preface your remarks with indications of honesty or directness, what does that say about everything else you say? If you say you’re being honest now, does that mean you usually aren’t? What if, instead, you cultivated a life and reputation in which honesty was as bankable as a note from the Treasury, as emphatic and explicit as a contract, as permanent as a tattoo?” TDS p.304
- “‘When you first rise in the morning tell yourself: I will encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.1 …The point of this preparation is not to write off everyone in advance. It is that, maybe, because you’ve prepared for it, you’ll be able to act with patience, forgiveness, and understanding” The Daily Stoic, p.108
- “I can’t afford to hate people. I don’t have that kind of time.“ -Bob Ross; It’s important to forgive and forget, but that being said, you don’t have to keep suffering pain and injustice at the hand of another person. You don’t need to hate them, but you don’t need to engage them in your life either. At worst a person should be neutral to you.
- Love shouldn’t hurt
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/9tttc2/you_are_your_own_guide_in_life/?st=JO2G5QBZ&sh=d9b54847
- “If you can’t be genuine with someone and you have to twist your soul in knots trying to keep them sweet, you don’t have a relationship, you have abuse.” https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9occ2m/comment/e7t5okq?st=JNB8OM3Q&sh=9a128a7d
- The answer will always be no unless you ask
- When it comes to asserting yourself and having healthy relationships it can actually be pretty simple. If you’re missing someone, call them. Want to meet up? Invite. Want to be understood? Explain yourself. Have questions? Ask. Don’t like something? Say it. Like something? State it. Want something? Ask for it. Love someone? Tell them. Too often we hold stuff in out of fear or anxiety or not being overbearing. There will certainly be a learning period for how best to state and ask for what you need, but overall, the more you assert your wants and needs with love and self-reflection, the happier you’ll be. Just say what you’re thinking in the nicest way possible. For the most part, it’s that simple.

### Take Care of Yourself - Physically and Mentally
- “‘Work nourishes noble minds’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 31.5 …The mind and the body are there to be used — they turn on themselves when not put to some productive end. It’s sad to think that this kind of frustration is an everyday reality for a lot of people…Worse is when we try to push these feelings away by buying things, going out, fighting, creating drama — indulging in the empty calories of existence instead of finding the real nourishment. The solution is simple and, thankfully, always right at hand. Get out there and work.” TDS, p.163
- “Take care of yourself like you were someone you cared for” -Jordan Peterson
- Find 3 hobbies: one to make you money, one to keep you in shape, and one to keep you creative.
- Physical
    - “No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” - Socrates
    - Get good (consistent and long) sleep. Good sleep is underrated. It’s so vital to good health. https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/brain-researchers-warn-that-lack-of-sleep-is-a-public-health-crisis/
    - Exercise. Bodies are made for moving, not sitting.
    - “Indeed, to one who is active, no day is long. So let us lengthen our lives; for the duty and the proof of life consist in action. Cut short the night: use some of it for the day’s business. Birds that are being prepared for the banquet, that they may be flattened through lack of exercise, are kept in the dark. And similarly, if men vegetate without physical activity, their idle bodies are overwhelmed with flesh, and in their self-satisfied retirement the fat of indolence grows upon them” -Seneca
    - “Exercise is a celebration of what you can do, not a punishment for what you ate”
    - Use food for sustenance, not pleasure. Modern bounty makes food-related sickness extremely common (high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, etc)
    - “One should by constant practice accustom himself to choosing food not for enjoyment but for nourishment, not to tickle his palate but to strengthen his body.” Musonius Rufus, Lectures,  On Food, XVIIIB
    - Avoid drinking soda. It’s poison. Consume sugar sparingly. Stick to whole foods, white meat and fish, lots of veggies, lots of fruits. Good fats, fewer carbs.
    - Go on at least 3 walks a week
    - Old-age health is determined, for the parts you can control, by your lifestyle now. Eat healthily, exercise, and sleep well now. https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/a4cpt6/in_a_new_study_involving_people_over_70_who_have/?st=JPH4PHEV&sh=10422a36
- Mental
    - “Your brain is the most incredible and complex object in the universe. …The good news is for no money down…you get the one free copy of the universe’s most complex and powerful object. It’s yours for life…You break it, it’s broken. Seat belts, bike helmets and exercise are mandatory. For power, your brain recharges with six to eight hours of sleep a day and as much healthy food as possible.” The Happiness Equation p.193
    - Stress is the modern smoking, overexposure to cortisol leads to diminished physical health https://newatlas.com/stress-autoimmune-disease-ptsd/55109/ in this case being mentally healthy (free of stress is closely tied to physical health
    - “Our stress response is usually the old fight or flight, we face a threat, e.g a bear, adrenaline gets released, hearts beat faster, lots of other stress hormones like cortisol get released, blood is diverted from your gut to your muscles, which is where the digestive issues come from, cortisol also raises your blood sugar so that you have the energy to run or fight. In todays world we don't face many bears, deadlines, annoying bosses, traffic all cause us stress, But there is no physical threat to deal with but all these hormones are still there, almost like revving up the engine with the brakes on, over time this upsets your digestive system, effects blood sugar levels, blood pressure and heart. If you exercise, especially when stressed, you are putting these systems to their original use, and use up the hormones, sugar etc, and exercise your cardiovascular system and muscles, adrenaline and cortisol levels drop and you are less stressed,  I like to imagine that the endorphin high after exercise is knowing that you escaped that bear!” https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/9ntukk/comment/e7p0o9y?st=JN8AUST3&sh=524a1511
    - “How much pain have cost us the evils which have never happened!” Thomas Jefferson

    - You should seek to have the same aversion to over-happiness as you do to over-sadness, because they’re both mental agitation. Seek to be even-keeled, but don’t be afraid of emotion, it’s natural. Just be deliberate and mindful of the state when emotions are high. (“If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same” If, Rudyard Kipling)
    - “’Hecato says “‘cease to hope and you will cease to fear.” …The primary cause of both these ills is that instead of adapting ourselves to present circumstances we send out thoughts too far ahead.’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 5.7b-8 Hope is generally regarded as good. Fear is generally regarded as bad. To a Stoic like Hecato…they are the same — both are projections in the future about things we do not control. Both are the enemy of this present moment that you are actually in. Both mean you’re living a life in opposition to amor fati...both contain a dangerous amount of want and worry. And, sadly, the want is what causes the worry.” TDS p.314
    - Build and support and rely upon and internal locus of control, motivation, and love.
    - Know what you can control and what you can’t; hint: you can only control your attitude and your mind. Let go of what you can’t control (God used to be my representation of what i couldn’t control, i would pass that all off to him, re-learn to let the things you can’t control go in some way)
    - At the end of the day, go over the positive things about it in your head. Positively introspect a little bit about your life, your relationships etc. Find the good about the day.
    - Find 3-5 things to be grateful for from the past week.
    - “The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5b
    - Your brain needs just as much exercise as your body. “Never retire. Your brain needs exercise or it will atrophy.” Bill Safire, quoting James Watson in a Jan 24 2005 op-ed

    - “Carrying out five random acts of kindness a week dramatically improves your happiness” The Happiness Equation, p.21
    - “Anger as soon as it is fed, is dead - ’Tis starving makes it fat” -Emily Dickenson
    - “There is no more stupefying thing than anger, nothing more bent on its own strength. If successful, none more arrogant, if foiled, none more insane — since it’s not driven back by weariness even in defeat, when fortune removes its adversary it turns its teeth on itself.” - Seneca, On Anger, 3.1.5, The Daily Stoic, p.50
    - “‘It’s ruinous for the soul to be anxious about the future and miserable in advance of misery, engulfed by anxiety that the things it desires might remain its own until the very end. For such a soul will never one at rest — by longing for things to come it will lose the ability to enjoy present things’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 98.5b-6a Feeling bad in advance is totally voluntary…The pragmatist, the person of action, is too busy to waste time on such silliness….Let the news come when it does. Be too busy working to care.“  TDS p.250

    - “When forced, as it seems, by circumstances into utter confusion, get ahold of yourself quickly. Don’t be locked out of the rhythm any longer than necessary. You’ll be able to keep the beat if you are constantly returning to it.” -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.11 TDS p.283 — This is knows as Noting in the mindfulness meditation world. Stop. Note the chaos (emotion or thought). Return to the rhythm of your breath.
    - “Nothing, to my way of thinking, is better proof of a well-ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.” Seneca
    - “Men seek retreats for themselves - in the country, by the sea, in the hills - and you yourself are particularly prone to this yearning. But all this is quite unphilosophic, when it is open to you, at any time you want, to retreat into yourself. No retreat offers someone more quiet and relaxation than that into his own mind, especially if he can dip into thoughts there which put him at immediate and complete ease: and by ease I simply mean a well-ordered life. So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself. The doctrines you will visit there should be few and fundamental, sufficient at one meeting to wash away all your pain and send you back free of resentment at what you must rejoin. And what is it you will resent? Human wickedness? Recall the conclusion that rational creatures are born for each other's sake, that tolerance is a part of justice, that wrongdoing is not deliberate. Consider the number of people who spent their lives in enmity, suspicion, hatred, outright war, and were then laid out for burial or reduced to ashes. Stop, then. Or will you fret at your allocation from the Whole? Revisit the alternatives -providence or atoms - and the many indications that the universe is a kind of community. But will matters of the flesh still have their hold on you? Consider that the mind, once it has abstracted itself and come to know its own defining power, has no contact with the movement of the bodily spirit, be that smooth or troubled: and finally remember all that you have heard and agreed about pain and pleasure. Well then, will a little fame distract you? Look at the speed of universal oblivion, the gulf of immeasurable time both before and after, the vacuity of applause, the indiscriminate fickleness of your apparent supporters, the tiny room in which all this is confined. The whole earth is a mere point in space: what a minute cranny within this is your own habitation, and how many and what sort will sing your praises here! Finally, then, remember this retreat into your own little territory within yourself. Above all, no agonies, no tensions. Be your own master, and look at things as a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. And here are two of the most immediately useful thoughts you will dip into. First that things cannot touch the mind: they are external and inert; anxieties can only come from your internal judgement. Second, that all these things you see will change almost as you look at them, and then will be no more. Constantly bring to mind all that you yourself have already seen changed. The universe is change: life is judgement. " - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4

- “‘Those who receive the bare theories immediately want to spew them, as an upset stomach does its food. First digest your theories and you won’t throw them up. Otherwise they will be raw, spoiled, and not nourishing. After you’ve digested them, show us the changes in your reasoned choices, just like the shoulders  of a gymnasts display their diet and training, and as the craft of artisans show it what they’ve learned’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 3.21.1-3 …Today, or anytime, when you catch yourself wanting to condescendingly drop some knowledge that you have, grab it and ask: Would i be better saying words or letting my actions and choices illustrate that knowledge for me.” The Daily Stoic p.137
- “’First practice not letting people know who you are — keep your philosophy to yourself for a bit. In just the manner that fruit is produced - the seed buried for a season, hidden, growing gradually so it may come to full maturity. But if the grain sprouts before the stalk is fully developed, it will never ripen…That is the kind of plant you are, displaying fruit too soon, and the winder will kill you.’ Epictetus, Discourses, 4.8.35b-37 “Just because you agree with the philosophy doesn’t mean the roots have fully taken hold in your mind. Fooling with books so you can sound smart or have an intimidating library is like tending to a garden to impress your neighbors…Do the work required to nurture and tend to them. So that they — and you — are prepared and sturdy for the hard winters of life” TDS p.277

- “Please god, we say, relieve me of my anxiety. Listen, stupid, you have hands. God gave them to you himself. You might as well get on your knees and pray your nose won’t run.

- “An archer is unlikely to hit a target she did  not aim for…our perceptions and principles guide us in the selection of what we want—but ultimately our actions determine whether we get there or not. So yes, spend some time—real, uninterrupted time—thinking about what’s important to you, what your priorities are. Then, work toward that and forsake all others. It’s not enough to wish and hope. One must act—and act right” The Daily Stoic, p.136

- First try to limit the decisions you make. Don’t decide between everything, reduce choices to a very limited set of options. Then make a decision and go with it, don’t look back. Don’t give yourself the option to go back on a choice. Avoid the anxiety of choice.

- “Autonomy and Freedom of choice are critical to our well being, and choice is critical to freedom and autonomy.

- Before acting: “First, don’t get upset — because that will color your decision negatively and make it harder than it needs to be. Second, remember the purpose and principles you value most. Running potential actions through this filter will eliminate the bad choices and highlight the right ones. Don’t get upset. Do the right thing. That’s it” The Daily Stoic, p.162
- “‘Work nourishes noble minds’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 31.5 …The mind and the body are there to be used — they turn on themselves when not put to some productive end. It’s sad to think that this kind of frustration is an everyday reality for a lot of people…Worse is when we try to push these feelings away by buying things, going out, fighting, creating drama — indulging in the empty calories of existence instead of finding the real nourishment. The solution is simple and, thankfully, always right at hand. Get out there and work.” TDS, p.163
- “Psychologists speak of cognitive distortions — exaggerated thinking patterns that have a destructive impact on the life of the patient. One of the most common is known as all-or-nothing thinking…This sort of extreme thinking is associated with depression and frustration. How could it not be? Perfectionism rarely begets perfection — only disappointment. Pragmatism has no such hang ups. It’ll take what it can get…We’re  never going to be perfect…We’re human after all. Our pursuits should be aimed at progress, however little that it’s possible for us to make.” TDS p.239

- ‘I’ll tell you how people can prove [the philosophers’] words to be their own — by putting into practice what they’ve been preaching’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 108.35;38 Even before Marcus’s time, Seneca was well aware that there was a lot of borrowing and overlap among philosophers. That’s because real philosophers weren’t concerned with authorship, only what worked. More important, they believed that what was said mattered less than what was done…The way you prove that you truly understand what you speak and write, that you truly are original, is to put them into practice.

It shouldn’t need your announcement, but readily be seen, as if written on your forehead, heard in the ring of your voice, a flash in your eyes — just as the beloved sees it all int he lover’s glance. In short, the straightforward and good person should be like a smelly goat — you know when they are in the room with you.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.15 If you have too preface your remarks with indications of honesty or directness, what does that say about everything else you say? If you say you’re being honest now, does that mean you usually aren’t?

### Be Disciplined, Strong, and Resilient
- Find a routine; structure and discipline breed mental stability and general health. Keep your house clean, do your chores, run your necessary errands, cook dinner, exercise, etc.

- “Once you learn that indulging might actually be worse than resisting, the urge begins to lose its appeal. In this way, self-control becomes the real pleasure, and the temptation becomes the regret” - The Daily Stoic, p.53
- Daily: meditate, plan, do, relax, meditate.
- Develop character
- “Character is a powerful defense in a world that would love to be able to seduce you, buy you, tempt you, and change you. If you know what you believe and why you believe it, you’ll avoid poisonous relationships, toxic jobs, fair-weather friends, and any number of ills that afflict people who haven’t thought through their deepest concerns. That’s your education. That’s why you do this work” The Daily Stoic, p.132
- Commit to things with substance, over which you have a measure of control. “‘Then what makes a beautiful human being? Isn’t it the presence of human excellence? Young friend, if you wish to be beautiful, then work diligently at human excellence. And what is that? Observe those whom you praise without prejudice. The just or the unjust? The just. The even-tempered or the undisciplined? The even-tempered. The self-controlled or the uncontrolled? the self-controlled. In making yourself that kind of person, you will become beautiful — but to the extent that you ignore those qualities, you’ll be ugly, event if you use every trick in the book to appear beautiful.’ Epictetus, Discourses, 3.1.6b-9; Our standards for what’s attractive are incredibly un-stoic in that we prize and extol things people have almost no control over — high cheekbones, complexion, height, piercing eyes. Is it really that beautiful to win the genetic lottery? Or should beauty be contingent on the choices, actions, and attributes we develop. An even keel, a sense of justice, a commitment to duty. These are beautiful traits — and they go much deeper than appearances.“ The Daily Stoic, p.140
- “Is something good or bad? Is this right or wrong? Ignore everything else. Focus only on your choices” The Daily Stoic, p.142
- “There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self.” - Ernest Hemingway

- “Watch your thoughts. They become words. Watch your words. They become deeds. Watch your deeds. They become habits. Watch your habits. They become character. Character is everything. Character becomes your destiny.” - Lao tzu
- “‘Every habit and capability is confirmed and grows in its corresponding actions, walking by walking, running by running…therefore, if you want to do something make a habit of it, if you don’t want to do that, don’t, but make a habit of something else instead.’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.1-5; Think about your activities of the last week as well as what you have planned for today and the week that follows. The person you’d like to be, or the person you see yourself as — how closely do your actions actually correspond to him or her? Which fire are you fueling? Which person are you becoming?” The Daily Stoic, p.147
- “We are what we repeatedly do, therefore, excellence is not an act, but a habit.” -Aristotle (The Daily Stoic, p.147)
- “Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind” -Marcus Aurelius (The Daily Stoic, p.147)
- “The question is do you possess the constitution, the depth of faith, to go as far as is needed?” - Boondocks Saints
- “‘If you don’t wish to be a hot-head, don’t feed your habit. Try as a first step to remain calm and count the days you haven’t been angry. For habit is first weakened and then obliterated. When you can say I didn’t lose my temper today, or the next day, or for three or four months, but keep my cool under provocation, you will know you are in better health.’- Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.11b-14 Success {is} a matter of momentum. once you get a little, it’s easier to keep going…Start with one day doing whatever if is…Then do the same the following day and the day after that. Build a chain and then work not to break it. Don’t ruin your streak.” [But if you do, just start again with one day] The Daily Stoic, p.150
- “Habit is first weakened and then obliterated” - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.11b-14
- “Instead of seeing philosophy as an end to which one aspires, see it as something one applies. Not occasionally, bot over the course of a life — making incremental progress along the way. Sustained execution, not shapeless epiphanies. Epictetus love to shake his students out of their smug satisfaction with their own progress, …to reming them of the constant work and serious training needed every day if we are ever to approach that perfect form. It’s important for us to remember in our own journey to self-improvement: one never arrives. The sage — the perfect Stoic who behaves perfectly in every situation — is an ideal, not an end” The Daily Stoic p.151
- “That’s why philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training. For as time passes we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite” - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.9.13-14 (The Daily Stoic p.153)
- “‘The fortunate person is the one who gives themselves a good fortune’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.36’ What is the more productive notion of good luck? On that is defined by totally random factors outside your control, or a matter of probability that can be increased — though not guaranteed — by the right decisions and the right preparation?. Obviously the latter…Today, you can hope that good fortune and good luck magically come your way. Or you can prepare yourself to get lucky by focusing on doing the right thing at the right time.” The Daily Stoic p.158
- “Diligence is the mother of good luck” The Daily Stoic p.158
- “I am a great believer in luck. The harder I work, the more of it I seem to have.” -Coleman Cox (The Daily Stoic p.158)
- “Luck favors the prepared” - Edna Mode, The Incredibles
- “‘Joy for human beings lies in proper human work. And proper human work consists in: acts of kindness to other human beings, disdain for the stirrings of the senses, identifying trustworthy impressions, and contemplating the natural order and all that happens in keeping with it’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.26 (The Daily Stoic p.159)
- Learn the principle of iteration; It will make you or break you. (death by a thousand cuts; winning is a game of percentages: he who tries more, wins more; take more shots; “By small and simple things, great things are brought to pass.”)
- “‘Well-being is realized by small steps, but is truly no small thing’ -Zeno; the truth is one we know well: the little things add up….While the individual action is small, its cumulative impact is not…Choose the right way, and watch as all these little things add up toward transformation.“ The Daily Stoic p.161

- “’You must build up your life action by action’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.32 If you follow The Process in your life — assembling the right actions in the right order, one right after the other — you too will do well. Not only that, you will be better equipped to make quick work of the obstacles along that path. You’ll be too busy putting one foot in front of the next to even notice the obstacles were there.” TDS, p.174
- “What assistance can we find in the fight against habit? Try the opposite!” -Epictetus, Discourses, 1.27.4 (TDS, p.192)
- ’Never shirk the proper dispatch of your duty, no matter if you are freezing or hot, groggy or well-rested, vilified or praised, not even if dying or pressed by other demands. Even dying is one of the important assignments of life and, in this as in all else, make the most of your resources to do well the duty at hand.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.2 (TDS p199)
- “’Were you then made for pleasure? In short, to be coddled or to exert yourself?’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.1 We cannot be of service to ourselves, to other people, or to the world unless we get up and get working.” TDS p.203
- “Learn to control your temper, your zipper, and your wallet.”
- Develop mental fortitude. “Think about someone you know who has character of granite…You might see a pattern: consistency…Why do we revere people like Teddy Roosevelt, for example?…It’s because those qualities are shot through every one of the stories about him. When he was young and weak, he became a boxer…When he was younger and frail, he went to a gym in his home, every day, for hours on end. When he was shattered by the loss of his wife and mother on the same day, he went to The Badlands and herded cattle.” TDS p.244
- “’Therefore, explain why a wise person shouldn’t get drunk — not with words, but by the facts of its ugliness and offensiveness. It’s most easy to prove that so-called pleasures, when they go beyond proper measure, are but punishments’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 83.27 [Stoics] don’t say, ‘Pleasure isn’t pleasurable.’ They say, ‘Endless pleasure becomes its own form of punishment.’” TDS p.252
- “’Men, the philosopher’s lecture-hall is a hospital — you shouldn’t walk out of it feeling pleasure, but pain, for you aren’t well when you enter it’ -Epictetus, Discourses, 3.23.30 …Stoic philosophy is a lot like [physical therapy]. Some observations or exercises will touch one of your pressure points. It’s nothing personal. It’s supposed to hurt. That’s how you’ll develop the will to endure and persevere through life’s many difficulties.” TDS p.264
- “I judge you unfortunate because you have never lived through misfortune. You have passed through life without and opponent — no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you.” - Seneca, On Providence, 4.3 (TDS p.266)

- “‘It is when times are good that you should gird yourself for tougher times ahead, for when Fortune is kind the soul can build defenses against her ravages.’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 18.5-6 What if you spent one day a month experiencing the effects of poverty, hunger, complete isolation, or any other thing you might fear? After the initial culture shock, it would start to feel normal and no longer quite so scary.” TDS p.272
- “If the bubble is never inflated, it won’t need to be popped. Overconfidence is a great weakness and a liability. But if you are already humble, no one will need to humble you - and the world is much less likely to have nasty surprises in store for you.” TDS p.274
- “The person who has been dealt a harder hand, understood it, but still triumphed? That’s greatness” TDS p.278
- “’Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it’s nothing to be ashamed of and that it can’t degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good…Pain is never unbearable or unending, so you can remember these limits and not add them in your imagination.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.64 ‘Nature is merciful’ [Churchill] later wrote…, ‘and does not try her children, man or beats, beyond their compass…Live dangerously; take things as they come; dread naught, all will be well.’ Nothing is unending. You just need to be strong and gracious enough to get through it.” TDS p.280
- “’Remember that to change your mind and to follow someone’s correction are consistent with a free will.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.16 The point is not to have an iron will, but an adaptable will — a will that makes full use of reason to clarify perception, impulse, and judgement to act effectively for the right purpose. It’s not weak to change and adapt. Flexibility is its own kind of strength. in fact, this flexibility combined with strength is what will make us resiliant and unstoppable.” TDS. p281

- “‘Your ruling reason becomes unconquerable when it rallies and relies on itself’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.48 When we repeat an action so often it becomes unconscious behavior, we can default to it without thinking… {For example,} Train yourself to give up anger and you won’t be angry at every fresh slight. Think about how many {behaviors} you’d like to be able to default to if you could. How many of them have you practiced only once. Let today be twice.” TDS p.285
- “‘No servitude is more abject than the self-imposed’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 47.17 Dependencies mean we’re not in control of our own lives — the dependency is. ‘Anyone who truly wants to be free,’ Epictetus said, ‘won’t desire something that is actually in someone else’s control, unless they want to be a slave.’ …Make yourself invulnerable to your dependency on comfort and convenience, or one day your vulnerability might bring you to your knees.” TDS p.287
- “If you accomplish something good with hard work, the labor passes quickly, but the good endures; if you do something shameful in pursuit of pleasure, the pleasure passes quickly, but the shame endures” - Musonius Rufus
- “‘How rotten and fraudulent when people say they intend to ‘give it to you straight.’ What are you up to, dear friend? It shouldn’t need your announcement, but readily be seen, as if written on your forehead, heard in the ring of your voice, a flash in your eyes — just as the beloved sees it all int he lover’s glance. In short, the straightforward and good person should be like a smelly goat — you know when they are in the room with you.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.15 If you have too preface your remarks with indications of honesty or directness, what does that say about everything else you say? If you say you’re being honest now, does that mean you usually aren’t? What if, instead, you cultivated a life and reputation in which honesty was as bankable as a note from the Treasury, as emphatic and explicit as a contract, as permanent as a tattoo?” TDS p.304
- “Do you want six-pack abs because you are challenging yourself and committing to a difficult goal? Or is it because you want to look good.  Are you running a marathon because you want to test your limits or because you’re running away from problems at home? Our will shouldn’t be directed at becoming the person who is in perfect shape or who can speak multiple languages but who doesn’t have a second for other people. What’s the point of winning at sports but losing in the effort to be a good husband, wife, father, mother, son, or daughter? Let’s not confuse getting at stuff with being a better person. One is a much bigger priority than the other.” TDS p.315
- “The you seek to advance your own position in life, character is the best lever.” TDS p.322
- “You were born with an attraction to virtue and self-mastery. If you’ve gotten far from that, it’s not out of some inborn corruption but from a nurturing of the wrong things and the wrong ideas. As Seneca has pointed out, philosophy is a tool to strip it all away and get back to our true nature.” TDS p.324
- “’Don’t trust in your reputation, money, or position, but in the strength that is yours — namely, your judgments about the things that you control and don’t control. For this alone is what makes us free and unfettered.’ - Epictetus, Discourses, 3.26,34-35 It just means focusing on and acquiring power rather than outward. As Publilius Syrus, himself a former slave, put it: ‘Would you have a great empire? Rule over yourself!’“ TDS p.332
- “’When philosophy is wielded with arrogance and stubbornly, it is the cause for the ruin of many. Let philosophy scrape off your own faults, rather than be a way to rail against the faults of others.’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 103.4b-5a The proper direction of philosophy is focused inward. To make ourselves better and to leave other people to that task for themselves and their own journey…Leave other people to their faults. Nothing in Stoic philosophy empowers you to judge them — only to accept them.” TDS p.342

### Be Smart
- You have a powerful brain, use it, exercise it. You want to keep it good and string for your whole life.
- “Your brain is the most incredible and complex object in the universe. …The good news is for no money down…you get the one free copy of the universe’s most complex and powerful object. It’s yours for life…You break it, it’s broken. Seat belts, bike helmets and exercise are mandatory. For power, your brain recharges with six to eight hours of sleep a day and as much healthy food as possible.” The Happiness Equation p.193
- “Never retire. Your brain needs exercise or it will atrophy.” Bill Safire, quoting James Watson in a Jan 24 2005 op-ed
- “Take a little time today to remember that you’re blessed with the capacity to use logic and reason to navigate situations and circumstances. This gives you unthinkable power to alter your circumstances and the circumstances of others. And remember that with power comes responsibility.” The Daily Stoic, p.86
- “If you really learned how to think, how to pay attention, then you will know that you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow consumer-hell-type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness that connects all things, not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that’s capital T true is that you get to decide how you’re gonna try and see it. This, I submit, is the freedom of real education, of learning how to be well adjusted, you get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn’t. That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness.” David Foster Wallace, This is Water, https://vimeo.com/107746121
- “It is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it”
- Learn as much as you can, either about one field, or many.
- “When you’re through changing, you’re through” -Bill Safire, Jan 24 2005 op-ed
- Get your ego out of it. “It is impossible for a person to begin to learn what he thinks he already knows” The Daily Stoic, p.84
- “What influences the ruling reason that guides your life? This means an exploration of subjects like evolutionary biology, psychology, neurology, and even the subconscious. Because these deeper forces shape even the most disciplined, rational minds…So don’t stop at Stoicism, but explore the forces that drive and make stoicism possible…Understand not only your ruling reason…but whoever and whatever rules that too.” The Daily Stoic, p.96
- “We must fight our biases and preconceptions…Ask yourself: What haven’t I considered? Why is this thing the way it is? Am I part of the problem here or the solution? Could I be wrong here?…We’re not as smart and wise as we’d like to think we are. If we ever do want to become wise, it comes from the questioning and from humility - not, as many would like to think, from certainty, mistrust, and arrogance.” The Daily Stoic, p.109
- “‘Work nourishes noble minds’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 31.5 …The mind and the body are there to be used — they turn on themselves when not put to some productive end” TDS, p.163
- “From the very beginning, make it your practice to say to every impression ‘you are an impression and not at all what you appear to be.” Next, examine and test it by the rules you possess, the first and greatest of which is this - whether it belongs to the things in our control or not in our control, and if the latter, be prepared to respond, ‘It is nothing to me’” Epictetus, Enchiridon, 1.5; The Daily Stoic, p.111
- “Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him” - Emerson, The Daily Stoic, p.113
- “If you want to learn, if you want to improve your life, seeking out teachers, philosophers, and great books is a good starts. But this approach will only be effective if you’re humble and ready to let go of opinions you already have.” The Daily Stoic, p.113
- “If anyone can prove and show to me that I think and act in error, I will gladly change it - for I seek the truth, by which no one has ever been harmed. The one who is harmed is the one who abides in deceit and ignorance.” Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.21; The Daily Stoic, p.127
- “No one should be ashamed at changing his mind - that’s what the mind is for….That’s why we go to such lengths to learn and expose ourselves to wisdom. It would be embarrassing if we didn’t end up finding out if we were wrong in the past” The Daily Stoic, p.127
- We should investigate things, challenge them, deconstruct them, and probe them; try to understand them by looking at them from a different angle. “’Turn it inside out and see what it is like - what it becomes like when old, sick, or prostituting itself’ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.21 By examining situations from the inside out, we can be less daunted by them, less likely to be swayed by them.” The Daily Stoic, p.129
- “Just as what is considered rational or irrational differs for each person, in the same way what is good or evil and useful or useless differs for each person. This is why we need education, so that we might learn how to adjust our preconceived notions of the rational and irrational in harmony with nature.” Epictetus, Discourses, 1.2.5-7; The Daily Stoic, p.132
- “That’s why philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training. For as time passes we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite.” - Epictetus, Discourses, 2.9.13-14 (The Daily Stoic p.153)
- “‘Its better to plant the seeds of a few authors than to be scattered about by many.’ - Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 9.4; What if, when it came to your reading and learning, you prioritized quality over quantity?…Your shelves might be emptier, but your brain and your life would be fuller” The Daily Stoic, p.154
- Passion is vital to genius and intelligence. The more you love to learn, the more you will learn. The more you love about a topic, the more you’ll know about it.
- “Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius.” - Mozart
- Emotional Intelligence is a greater predictor of success than IQ. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html
- “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go” - Dr. Seuss, Oh, The Places You’ll Go
- “A scholar tries to learn something everyday; a student of Buddhism tries to unlearn something daily.” - Alan Watts (What bad habits, bad prejudices, bad notions do you hold? Unlearn them. Deleting code can be better than adding it. "Deleted code is debugged code." - Jeff Sickel)
- Study, internalize, act, meditate.
- “‘We like to say that we don’t get to choose our parents, that they were given by chance — yet we can truly choose whose children we’d like to be” -Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 15.3a’ Maybe your parents were poor role models, or you lacked a great mentor. Yet if we choose to, we can easily access the wisdom of those who came before us — those whom we aspire to be like. TDS, 173
- “‘How laughable it is to say, ‘Tell me what to do!’ What advice could i possibly give? No, a far better request is, ‘Train my mind to adapt to any circumstance’…In this way, if circumstances take you off script…you won’t be desperate for a new prompting’ -Epictetus, Discourses, 2.2.20b-1;24b-25a Instead of looking for instruction, cultivate skills like creativity, independence, self-confidence, ingenuity, and the ability to problem solve” The Daily Stoic, p.178
- “‘This is what you should teach me, how to be like Odysseus…how, even after suffering shipwreck, I might keep sailing on course go those honorable ends.’ - Seneca, Moral Letters, 88.7b We’re not trying to ace tests or impress teachers. We are reading and studying to live, to be good human beings — always and forever” TDS p.204
- “‘For I believe a good king is from the outset and by necessity a philosopher, and the philosopher is from the outset a kingly person’ -Musonius Rufus, Lectures, 8.33.32-34 The study of philosophy cultivates our reason and ethics so that we can do our job well.” TDS p.206
- “Philosophy isn’t a parlor trick or made for show. It’s not concerned with words, but with facts. It’s not employed for some pleasure before the day is spend, or to relieve the uneasiness of our leisure. It shapes and builds up the soul, it gives order to live, guides action, show what should and shouldn’t be done…Without it, no one can live without fear or free from care.” Seneca, Moral Letters, 16.3 (TDS p.243)
- “’I’ll never be ashamed to quote a bad writer with a good saying’ -Seneca, On Tranquility, 11.8 Who cares if some bit of wisdom is from a stoic, who cares whether it perfectly jibes with Stoicism? What matters is whether it makes your life better, whether it makes you better.” TDS p.253
- A master has failed more times than a novice has tried
- ’I surely will use the older path, but if i find a shorter and smoother way, I’ll blaze a trail there. The ones who pioneered these paths aren’t our masters, but our guides. Truth stands open to everyone, it hasn’t been monopolized.’ -Seneca, Moral Letters, 33.11
- “’Remember that to change your mind and to follow someone’s correction are consistent with a free will.’ -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.16 Conditions change. New facts come in. Circumstances arise. If you can’t adapt…you are no better than a robot. The point is not to have an iron will, but an adaptable will — a will that makes full use of reason to clarify perception, impulse, and judgement to act effectively for the right purpose. It’s not weak to change and adapt. Flexibility is its own kind of strength.” TDS. p281
- “If anyone can refute met — show me i’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective — i’ll gladly change. It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone.” - Marcus Aurelius Mediations, 6.21
- “‘Aren’t you ashamed to reserve for yourself only the remnants of your life and to dedicate to wisdom only that time that can’t be directed to business?  - Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 3.5b Philosophy shouldn’t have to accept what time or energy is left over from other occupations but instead we should graciously make time for those other pursuits only once our study is finished…Why do we block off eight to ten hours in the middle of the day to be at the office or go to meetings, but block out no timer thinking about the big questions?” TDS p.323

### Be Judicious with Technology
- “Revamp your bucket list. Live in the moment. Put down your phone. Notice the people around you.”
- Technology takes you away from being present in the moment. Every moment you spend needlessly perusing your phone while your life happens around you, is a moment you miss, you don’t get to be part of, and one you don’t get back. I went through the car wash with 3-yr-old Nate. I have a vague memory of him bouncing excitedly back and forth in the car watching the scrubber and water go back and forth, but I was dialed into something unimportant on my phone, wasting time, and I missed that moment. I missed taking in his laughs, and laughing and engaging with him about something he was way into. And that’s the real problem, when you don’t engage with the people around you on stuff they see as important, you miss connecting with them and being there with them. You miss building memories. You’re not emphasizing experience in your life when you’re glued to your phone.
- Completely unplug regularly. It’s good for your mental health. It’ll keep you present
- Technology is there to serve you, not for you to be addicted to and escape and waste time. Learn how to be measured in your integration of technology in you life.
- Technology addiction can distract you from living on purpose. Use it wisely and mindfully.

- “We can find a retreat at any time by looking inward. We can sit with our eyes closed and feel our breath go in and out. We can turn on some music and tune out the world. We can turn off technology or shut off those rampant thoughts in our head. That will provide peace. Nothing else.” The Daily Stoic, p.91
- “‘The richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewal.’ …{The Power of Full Engagement}… A Kansas State University study found that complete downtime after work helps us recharge for the next day. Turning your phone off after dinner. Not using the internet on vacation.” The Happiness Equation, p.22
- “Of all the paths you take in life, make sure some of them are dirt.” John Muir
- Technology, at least in 2018, is really good at bringing out the worst tendencies in people: narcissism, greed, egoism, gossip, laziness. The way FB algorithms work, for example, is by giving you more of what you choose to view, and more often than not, what you choose to view appeals to your baser emotions like anger (e.g. an article about how the other political party is stupid). More often than not, technology feeds your sloth and rage and judgmental attitudes. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959
- Also, social media can lead to feelings of inadequacy and discouragement. You end up comparing your worst moments to peoples’ best moments.

#### The Last Time (https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/7upwj7/damn/dtmjxlf/?sh=e4e4d783&st=JD63KIUB)
```
From the moment you hold your baby in your arms,
you will never be the same.
You might long for the person you were before,
When you have freedom and time,
And nothing in particular to worry about.
You will know tiredness like you never knew it before,
And days will run into days that are exactly the same,
Full of feedings and burping,
Nappy changes and crying,
Whining and fighting,
Naps or a lack of naps,
It might seem like a never-ending cycle.
But don’t forget …
There is a last time for everything.
There will come a time when you will feed
your baby for the very last time.
They will fall asleep on you after a long day
And it will be the last time you ever hold your sleeping child.
One day you will carry them on your hip then set them down,
And never pick them up that way again.
You will scrub their hair in the bath one night
And from that day on they will want to bathe alone.
They will hold your hand to cross the road,
Then never reach for it again.
They will creep into your room at midnight for cuddles,
And it will be the last night you ever wake to this.
One afternoon you will sing “the wheels on the bus” and do all the actions,
Then never sing them that song again.
They will kiss you goodbye at the school gate,
The next day they will ask to walk to the gate alone.
You will read a final bedtime story and wipe your last dirty face.
They will run to you with arms raised for the very last time.
The thing is, you won’t even know it’s the last time
Until there are no more times.
And even then, it will take you awhile to realize.
So while you are living in these times,
remember there are only so many of them
and when they are gone, you will yearn for just one more day of them.
For one last time.

#### _Leisure_, W. H. Davies
```
What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.
No time to stand beneath the boughs
And stare as long as sheep or cows.
No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.
No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.
No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance.
No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began.
A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.
```

#### _If_ — Rudyard Kipling
```
If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too; 
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
```

### _Wandrers Nachtsong 1_
```
Der du von dem Himmel bist,
Alles Leid und Schmerzen stillest,
Den, der doppelt elend ist,
Doppelt mit Erquickung füllest;
Ach, ich bin des Treibens müde!
Was soll all der Schmerz und Lust?
Süßer Friede,
Komm, ach komm in meine Brust!
```

_Wandrers Nachtsong 2_
```
Über allen Gipfeln
Ist Ruh,
In allen Wipfeln
Spürest du
Kaum einen Hauch;
Die Vögelein schweigen im Walde.
Warte nur, balde
Ruhest du auch.

### General
-Affiirmatons of Humanism-
We are committed to the application of reason and science to the understanding of the universe and to the solving of human problems.
We deplore efforts to denigrate human intelligence, to seek to explain the world in supernatural terms, and to look outside nature for salvation.
We believe that scientific discovery and technology can contribute to the betterment of human life.
We believe in an open and pluralistic society and that democracy is the best guarantee of protecting human rights from authoritarian elites and repressive majorities.
We are committed to the principle of the separation of church and state.
We cultivate the arts of negotiation and compromise as a means of resolving differences and achieving mutual understanding.
We are concerned with securing justice and fairness in society and with eliminating discrimination and intolerance.
We believe in supporting the disadvantaged and the handicapped so that they will be able to help themselves.
We attempt to transcend divisive parochial loyalties based on race, religion, gender, nationality, creed, class, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, and strive to work together for the common good of humanity.
We want to protect and enhance the earth, to preserve it for future generations, and to avoid inflicting needless suffering on other species.
We believe in enjoying life here and now and in developing our creative talents to their fullest.
We believe in the cultivation of moral excellence.
We respect the right to privacy. Mature adults should be allowed to fulfill their aspirations, to express their sexual preferences, to exercise reproductive freedom, to have access to comprehensive and informed health-care, and to die with dignity.
We believe in the common moral decencies: altruism, integrity, honesty, truthfulness, responsibility. Humanist ethics is amenable to critical, rational guidance. There are normative standards that we discover together. Moral principles are tested by their consequences.
We are deeply concerned with the moral education of our children. We want to nourish reason and compassion.
We are engaged by the arts no less than by the sciences.
We are citizens of the universe and are excited by discoveries still to be made in the cosmos.
We are skeptical of untested claims to knowledge, and we are open to novel ideas and seek new departures in our thinking.
We affirm humanism as a realistic alternative to theologies of despair and ideologies of violence and as a source of rich personal significance and genuine satisfaction in the service to others.
We believe in optimism rather than pessimism, hope rather than despair, learning in the place of dogma, truth instead of ignorance, joy rather than guilt or sin, tolerance in the place of fear, love instead of hatred, compassion over selfishness, beauty instead of ugliness, and reason rather than blind faith or irrationality.
We believe in the fullest realization of the best and noblest that we are capable of as human beings.


### Family
The things my patients say they'll miss the most are NOT seeing the World Landmarks, buying fancy things, that new car, "living it up" party style, etc. (https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/80dsy9/lpt_after_working_with_terminally_ill_cancer/)
Here is an actual compiled list:
* Watching my sons throw a baseball
* Listening to my grandparents tell stories
* My girlfriend surprising me with a kiss on the cheek
* Holding my wife in my arms knowing there's no where in the world I'd rather be
* Gram's Sunday dinners and the whole family getting together
* My dog
* Seeing my fiancé smile and feeling his arms wrap around me
* My daughter running to me when I get home
* The smell of flowers and rain
* The day I got married. I said I never would. And then I met her. And now I have to leave her.
* Smelling the fireplace on Christmas morning with the family
* All my friends
* Watching my family sleep
* The rush of weekday mornings. I know it sounds crazy, but I'll miss it. I'll miss the coffee, the crowded bathrooms, my wife's quick peck goodbye, the kids forgetting their lunch.. you get my point
* Rain. Is that weird?
....notice none of these things cost any money. They don't include technology. They're not grand gestures. It's human to human (or animals/nature) interaction, something we need more of in world that's becoming more fast paced and less human every day.


#### My adopted take on the family:
- we believe marriage between people who love each other is a good thing
- families are unique and diverse
- no family looks the same and that is okay
- all human beings, male and female and everyone in between, are awesome
- gender is personal, sometimes it’s complicated, sometimes it is not we respect all expressions of gender
- intimacy is an expression of affection between people who love each other and is nobody’s business
- parents have a responsibility to:
    - provide for their child’s physical, emotional and spiritual welfare, love their child without condition or constraint
    - teach their child how to love themselves
    - teach their child how to love others
- by design parents are equal parters, together, they preside, provide, protect, nurture, nourish
- families are established and maintained on principles of love, compassion, respect, trust, honesty, and integrity
- our family is inherently beautiful


## The Problem with Religion
...is that it takes good and useful truths and attaches them to God. These truths can stand on their own” - Sam Harris

### Top 3 Reasons I left the Mormon church:
To me, these things are dangerous and harmful, and if they’re true, then the church isn’t. A perfect God wouldn’t do it this way; yes men are flawed, but God is perfect, so he could easily and should help his men avoid these pitfalls.
1. information suppression, whitewashing, gaslighting, rhetorical control, ideological rigidity, historical revisionism (mostly about church history, but it applies currently as well), technophobia - the church wants to control information, god would have no need for this

2. The Church runs more like a Business (Jesus Christ Inc.) than a religion  - the lds version of corporatism- for all their claim to neutrality they sure love to take up stake in politics. But they are also shrewd businessmen, getting their fingers into any profitable pie they can. They're basically just another copy of a lobbying, conservative corporation, it shows in their business dealings and in their stances. Doesn't seem very Christlike, and it doesn't seem like something the “true and living church of Christ” would have need for

3. Cultural oppression - treatment of women, minorities, homosexuals, other nationalities - gaslighting members - manipulation of exmormons, pushing homogeneity
    - The most christlike person i can think of in modern history isn’t even mormon: Fred Rogers. And weirdly enough, none of the church leaders comes across near as christlike as Mr. Rogers. I would expect them to, bring Jesus’ servants. They do not exude christlike love and acceptance to everyone the way Mr. Rogers did.
    - Also what Mohammad Bzeek does almost exactly what I picture Christ would do http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-foster-father-sick-children-2017-story.html. There is disparity between Christlike behavior and his supposed church
    - The church should be a light-years-ahead leader on social issues, given their assumed divine guidance, but instead they often lag behind the advancement of social issues (e.g. https://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng “The justifications for this restriction echoed the widespread ideas about racial inferiority”, https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/89uzrg/dont_forget_that_it_was_10_years_after_ml_kings/?st=JFM3QTUN&sh=d3469adc)
    - “I am thinking about how much we do for so few and how little we do for so many.

4. Bonus: The Church and Social Progress - The church should be a thought leader on love and acceptance with the Master of love and acceptance leading them; but they are never on the forefront of social issues that turn out to be objectively, demonstrably good for everyone. This runs counter to the way you’d expect from God’s true church.
    - Civil Rights for Blacks (specifically priesthood, interracial marrying, etc, used to be widely frowned upon and preached against in the church as a very bad thing. It wasn’t until BYU was about to lose accreditation in the 70s that the church finally came around and removed the priesthood ban)
    - Gay Acceptance (They are not accepting, they are more than just indifferent, they are actively tormenting the individuals that would actually like to be part of their church by classifying homosexuality as apostasy (https://www.lds.org/church/news/elder-christofferson-says-handbook-changes-regarding-same-sex-marriages-help-protect-children?lang=eng&_r=1), but not adultery or murder, wtf? plus the children of homosexual parents who wish to be baptized must wait until they are 18 and then fully disavow their gay parents)

    - They don’t actually provide that much humanitarian aid around the world (https://i.redd.it/2tja1dmkgfp01.jpg, the Seventh Day Adventists give more percent-wise than the LDS church does; they earn less  and give more)
    - The church doesn’t use much of its money to give aid http://followtheprophets.com/tithing-money/

_Just in case you think it’s easy to leave a religion you devoted a good chunk of life to:_
“It was lonely to unravel. But more than that, it simply hurts to unbecome, to feel the ideological foundation of life ripping apart.” “Disabuse rarely visits like the tooth fairy, taking away your rotted belief system and leaving you a shiny new one in its place. It takes years of collapsing and years of rebuilding.”

### My occams razor conclusion: The church's truth claims are patently, demonstrably false; it is not led by God, but by regular men (who happen to be moral traditionalists), pushing their own ideology (as well as covering up past versions of this ideology)

“So you have to ask yourself. What’s more likely? That {JS} plagiarized the Book of Mormon and copied the free masons temple ceremony to get money. And that polygamy was because he was a pervert.
Or that it’s from God and his most important use of an angel and a flaming sword was to get Joseph to marry a young girl. And the Book of Mormon just happens to be historically inaccurate and plagiarized and the temple just happens to be very similar to Masonry.
If you allow yourself to consider that it could not be true and just look at the evidence from all sides it gets clear really fast.” - Steph

#### “Anti-Mormon" literature
1. A couple’s story: cites and summarizes all the church linked essays: https://whyweleft.wordpress.com/
2. Translation of BoA https://www.lds.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng - BoA is bogus, the Abraham papyrus is nonsense
3. BOM translation procedure different from traditional portrayals and teaching https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng&_r=1 - used seer stone instead of U&T and plates: “Apparently for convenience, Joseph often translated with the single seer stone rather than the two stones bound together to form the interpreters … Most of the accounts speak of Joseph’s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone), and many accounts refer to his use of a single stone. According to these accounts, Joseph placed either the interpreters or the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.” ‘She described Joseph “sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us. According to Emma, the plates “often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth.”’ Harris later related that as Joseph used the seer stone to translate, sentences appeared. Joseph read those sentences aloud, and after penning the words, Harris would say, “Written.” An associate who interviewed Harris recorded him saying that Joseph “possessed a seer stone, by which he was enabled to translate as well as from the Urim and Thummim, and for convenience he then used the seer stone.”
